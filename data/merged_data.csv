"A paperback (also known as softback or softcover) is a type of book characterized by a thick paper or cardboard cover, and often held together with glue rather than stitches or staples. In contrast, hardcover or hardback books are bound with cardboard covered with cloth; although more expensive, hardbacks are more durable. Inexpensive books bound in paper have existed since at least the 19th century in such forms as pamphlets, yellowbacks, dime novels, and airport novels. Most modern paperbacks are either ""mass-market paperbacks"" or ""trade paperbacks"".
Paperback editions of books are issued when a publisher decides to release a book in a low-cost format. Cheap paper, glued bindings, and the lack of a hard cover contribute to the inherent low cost of paperbacks. Paperbacks can be the preferred medium when a book is not expected to be a major seller, or in other situations where the publisher wishes to release a book without putting forth a large investment. Examples include many novels, and newer editions or reprintings of older books.
Since hardcovers tend to have a larger profit margin, publishers must balance the profit to be made by selling fewer hardcovers against the potential profit to be made by selling many paperbacks with a smaller profit per unit. First editions of many modern books, especially genre fiction, are issued in paperback. Best-selling books, on the other hand, may maintain sales in hardcover for an extended period in order to reap the greater profits that the hardcovers provide.","A paperback is a type of book.

"Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 â?24 March 1603) was Queen of England and Queen of Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death. Sometimes called The Virgin Queen, Gloriana or Good Queen Bess, Elizabeth was the sixth and last monarch of the Tudor dynasty. The daughter of Henry VIII, she was born a princess, but her mother, Anne Boleyn, was executed three years after her birth, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Perhaps for that reason, her brother, Edward VI, cut her out of the succession. His will, however, was set aside, as it contravened the Third Succession Act of 1543, in which Elizabeth was named as successor provided that Mary I of England, Elizabeth's half-sister, should die without issue. In 1558, Elizabeth succeeded Mary, during whose reign she had been imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels. Elizabeth set out to rule by good counsel, and she depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by William Cecil, Baron Burghley. One of her first moves was to support the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the Supreme Governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement held firm throughout her reign and later evolved into today's Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry, but despite several petitions from parliament, she never did. The reasons for this choice are unknown, and they have been much debated. As she grew older, Elizabeth became famous for her virginity, and a cult grew up around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants and literature of the day. In government, Elizabeth was more conservative than her father and siblings. One of her mottos was video et taceo: ""I see, and say nothing"". This strategy, viewed with impatience by her counsellors, often saved her from political and martial misalliances. Though Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs and only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France and Ireland, the defeat of the Spanish armada in 1588 associated her name forever with what is popularly viewed as one of the greatest victories in British history. Within twenty years of her death, she was being celebrated as the ruler of a golden age, an image that retains its hold on the English people. Elizabeth's reign is known as the Elizabethan era, famous above all for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake and slave-trader John Hawkins.
Historians, however, tend to be more cautious in their assessment. They often depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity to the point where many of her subjects were relieved at her death. Elizabeth is however acknowledged by historians as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor, in an age when government was ramshackle and limited and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. Such was the case with Elizabeth's rival, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom she imprisoned in 1568 and eventually executed in 1587. After the short reigns of Elizabeth's brother and sister, her forty-five years on the throne provided valuable stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.","Mary I had made the nation Catholic, but Elizabeth'

"In particle physics, antimatter is material composed of antiparticles, which have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but have opposite charge and other particle properties such as lepton and baryon number. Encounters between particles and antiparticles lead to the annihilation of both, giving rise to varying proportions of high-energy photons (gamma rays), neutrinos, and lower-mass particleâantiparticle pairs. Setting aside the mass of product neutrinos, the end result of annihilation is a release of energy proportional to the mass in accord with the mass-energy equivalence equation, E=mc2.
Antiparticles bind with each other to form antimatter in just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) and an antiproton can form an antihydrogen atom. Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements. To date, however, anti-atoms more complex than antihelium have neither been artificially produced nor observed in nature. Studies of cosmic rays have identified both positrons and antiprotons, presumably produced by high-energy collisions between particles of ordinary matter.
There is considerable speculation as to why the observable universe is apparently composed almost entirely of ordinary matter, as opposed to a more symmetric combination of matter and antimatter. This asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics. The process by which this asymmetry between particles and antiparticles developed is called baryogenesis.
Antimatter in the form of anti-atoms is one of the most difficult materials to produce. Antimatter in the form of individual anti-particles, however, is commonly produced by particle accelerators and in some types of radioactive decay.","Antimatter is a term in particle physics.

"Inspector Gadget is a science fiction animated series from the midâ?980s co-created by Andy Heyward, Jean Chalopin and Bruno Bianchi, and was originally syndicated by DIC Audiovisuel and Lexington Broadcast Services Company. The series stars the voice of Don Adams as the titular character, and first premiered on September 12, 1983. It is the first cartoon show to be syndicated by DIC, who specifically created the series to help expand into the North American market, and the first animated series to be presented in stereo sound. The program originally ran from 1983 to 1986, broadcasting 86 episodes over two seasons, and remained in syndication into the late 1990s. The show revolves around the adventures of a clumsy, dim-witted detective named Inspector Gadgetâa cyborg human with various bionic gadgets built into his bodyâwho is sent on missions to thwart plans by his nemesis Dr. Claw, the leader of an evil organization known as ""M.A.D."", unknowingly being assisted by his niece Penny and their dog, Brain.
The TV series proved to be a success for DIC, not only launching the Inspector Gadget franchise, including additional animated productions, such as a 2015 sequel series, and two live-action films, but also encouraging the company to produce additional programs such as Heathcliff.

"Allan Kardec was a pseudonym of Hippolyte LÃ©on Denizard Rivail (October 3, 1804 - March 31, 1869), compiler or codifier of the Spiritism.
Rivail was born in Lyon, France, in 1804. A disciple and collaborator of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, he spoke several languages and taught mathematics, astronomy, physiology, French, physics, chemistry and comparative anatomy. He was already in his early fifties when he became interested in the wildly popular phenomenon of spirit-tapping. At the time, strange phenomena attributed to the action of spirits were reported in many different places, most notably in the U.S. and France, attracting the attention of high society. The first such phenomena were at best frivolous and entertaining, featuring objects that moved or ""tapped"" under what was said to be spirit control. In some cases, this was alleged to be a type of communication: the supposed spirits answered questions by controlling the movements of objects so as to pick out letters to form words, or simply indicate ""yes"" or ""no.""
At the time, Franz Mesmer's theory of animal magnetism was popular in the upper reaches of society. When confronted with the phenomena described, many researchers including Rivail pointed out that animal magnetism might explain them. Rivail, however, after personally seeing a demonstration, quickly dismissed the animal-magnetism hypothesis as being insufficient to completely explain all the facts observed. Rivail was determined to understand exactly what was causing the physical effects popularly attributed to spirits.
As an academic with a solid scientific background, Rivail decided to do his own research. Not being a medium, he compiled a list of questions and began working with mediums and channelers to pose them to spirits. Soon the quality of communication with spirits appeared to improve markedly. In 1857 Rivail (signing himself ""Allan Kardec"") published his first book on Spiritism, The Spirits Book. It comprised a series of 1,018 questions exploring matters concerning the nature of spirits, the spirit world, and the relations between the spirit world and the material world. This was followed by a series of other books, like The Book on Mediums and The Gospel According to Spiritism, and by a periodical, the Revue Spirite, which Kardec published until his death.
Rivail first used the name ""Allan Kardec"" allegedly after some spirits with whom he had been communicating told him about a previous incarnation of his as a Druid by that name. Rivail liked the name and decided to use it to keep his Spiritualist writings separate from his academic work.

"The Spanish Civil War[nb 2] was fought from 17 July 1936 to 1 April 1939 between the Republicans, who were loyal to the established Spanish Republic, and the Nationalists, a rebel group led by General Francisco Franco. The Nationalists prevailed, and Franco ruled Spain for the next 36 years, from 1939 until his death in 1975. The war began after a pronunciamiento (declaration of opposition) by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces under the leadership of JosÃ© Sanjurjo against the elected government of the Second Spanish Republic, at the time under the leadership of President Manuel AzaÃ±a. The rebel coup was supported by a number of conservative groups, including the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right,[nb 3] monarchists such as the religious conservative Carlists, and the Fascist Falange.[nb 4]
The coup was supported by military units in Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos, Valladolid, CÃ¡diz, Cordova, and Seville. However, rebelling units in important cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, and MÃ¡laga were unable to capture their objectives, and those cities remained in control of the government. Spain was thus left militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists, now led by General Francisco Franco, and the Republican government fought it out for the control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions and soldiers from Nazi Germany, the Italy, while the Soviet Union and Mexico intervened in support of the ""Loyalist"", or ""Republican"", side. Other countries, such as Britain and France, operated an official policy of non-intervention, although France did send in some munitions. The Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. Capturing large parts of Catalonia in 1938 and 1939, the war ended with the victory of the Nationalists and the exile of thousands of left-leaning Spaniards, many of whom fled to refugee camps in southern France. Those associated with the losing Republicans were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists. With the establishment of a fascist dictatorship led by General Francisco Franco in the aftermath of the war, all right-wing parties were fused into the structure of the Franco regime.
The war became notable for the passion and political division it inspired and atrocities were committed by both sides in the war.

"Voltage is an electric potential difference between two points, and is measured in volts. It is named in honor of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745â?827), who invented the voltaic pile, the first chemical battery.","Voltage is the change in electric potential (meaning potential energy per unit charge) between two positions.
It is measured in volts. It was named after an Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who made the first chemical battery. Many other languages uses a word that means electric tension for voltage.
The voltage can be seen as the pressure on the electrons to move out of the source, the higher the voltage, the higher the pressure, for example a battery of 3 volt will push on the electrons twice as hard as a battery of 1.5 volt.
The voltage can push the electrons into a component, for example a resistor, creating a current. Usually the voltage and the current are related by a formula (see impedance), for example in a resistor, when the voltage double the current also double.
The voltage is always measured between two points, for example between the positive and negative ends of a battery, or between a wire and ground. Note that there must both voltage and current to get power (energy), for example a wire can have a a high voltage on it, but unless it's connected, nothing will happen (that's why birds can land on high voltage lines without problems).
There are two types of voltage, DC or AC. The DC voltage (Direct Current voltage) always have the same polarity (positive or negative), for example in a battery. The AC voltage alternate between positive and negative, for example the voltage from the wall change polarity 60 times per second (in America). The DC is typically used for electronics and the AC for motors.","Voltage is a difference between two points , and is measured in volts .

"""Macula"" can also mean a ""stain on the soul"" in Catholicism; see mortal sin. ""Macula"" is also a term used in planetary geology, see Macula (planetary geology), and aerial archaeology see Macula (archaeology).
The macula or macula lutea (from Latin macula, ""spot"" + lutea, ""yellow"") is an oval yellow spot near the center of the retina of the human eye. It has a diameter of about 1.5 mm and is often histologically defined as having two or more layers of ganglion cells. Near its center is the fovea, a small pit that contains the largest concentration of cone cells in the eye and is responsible for central vision. It is specialized for high acuity vision. Within the macula are the fovea and foveola which contain a high density of cones (photoreceptors with high acuity). Whereas loss of peripheral vision may go unnoticed for some time, damage to the macula will result in loss of central vision, which is usually immediately obvious. The progressive destruction of the macula is a severe disease known as macular degeneration.
Visual input to the macula occupies a substantial portion of the brain's visual capacity. As a result, some forms of visual field loss can occur without involving the macula; this is termed macular sparing. (For example, visual field testing might demonstrate homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing.) This finding can be very informative for the ophthalmologist.","Yellow spot or macula is an oval yellow spot near the center of the retina of human eye. It has a size of 1.5 millimeters

"Wayne Rooney is a dumb twat Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson and starring the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. Loosely based on William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book Shrek!, the film was produced by DreamWorks Animation. Shrek was the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, a category introduced in 2001. It was released on VHS and DVD on November 2, 2001.
The film stars Mike Myers as a big, strong, solitude-loving, intimidating ogre named Shrek. Shrek also features Cameron Diaz as the beautiful but very down-to-earth and feisty Princess Fiona, Eddie Murphy as the talkative Donkey, and John Lithgow as the villain Lord Farquaad.
The film was commercially successful on release in 2001 and it helped establish DreamWorks as a prime competitor to Pixar in the field of feature film animation, particularly in computer animation. The film's success also made Dreamworks Animation create three sequels: Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, and Shrek Forever After. There was also a Christmas special called Shrek The Halls and a Halloween special called Scared Shrekless. Furthermore, Shrek was made the mascot for the company's animation productions. It was critically acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humor to appeal to children. It made notable use of popular music; the soundtrack includes music by Smash Mouth, Eels, Joan Jett, The Proclaimers, Jason Wade, The Baha Men, and John Cale (covering Leonard Cohen).

Another flagrant copyright infringement is the fact that this video album contains the track ""Still in Love (Kissing You)"", a cover of the song ""I'm Kissing You"" originally performed by Des'Ree. Des'ree filed a lawsuit against BeyoncÃ© on April 18, 2007, alleging Knowles never obtained proper clearance to use the song. Des'ree claims the terms her team submitted to Knowles for use of the song were not satisfactory, and as a result the former Destiny's Child star ignored copyright law and recorded her own version. The terms stated Knowles couldn't retitle the song or film a video using the track.

"The Crucible is a 1953 play by Arthur Miller, based on the the Salem witch trials.

"Cladistics (Ancient Greek: ÎºÎ»Î¬Î´Î¿Ï, klados, ""branch"") is a method of classifying species of organisms into groups called clades, which consist of an ancestor organism and all its descendants (and nothing else). For example, birds, dinosaurs, crocodiles, and all descendants (living or extinct) of their most recent common ancestor form a clade. In the terms of biological systematics, a clade is a single ""branch"" on the ""tree of life"", a monophyletic group.
Cladistics can be distinguished from other taxonomic systems, such as phenetics, by its focus on shared derived characters (synapomorphies). Systems developed earlier usually employed overall morphological similarity to group species into genera, families and other higher level groups (taxa); cladistic classifications (usually in the form of trees called cladograms) are intended to reflect the relative recency of common ancestry or the sharing of homologous features. Cladistics is also distinguished by an emphasis on parsimony and hypothesis testing (particularly falsificationism), leading to a claim that cladistics is more objective than systems which rely on subjective judgements of relationship based on similarity.
Cladistics originated in the work of the German entomologist Willi Hennig, who referred to it as ""phylogenetic systematics"" (also the name of his 1966 book); the use of the terms ""cladistics"" and ""clade"" was popularized by other researchers. The technique and sometimes the name have been successfully applied in other disciplines: for example, to determine the relationships between the surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales.
Cladists use cladograms â?diagrams which show ancestral relations between species â?to represent the monophyletic relationships of species, termed sister-group relationships. This is interpreted as representing phylogeny, or evolutionary relationships. Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters, genetic sequencing data and computational phylogenetics are now very commonly used in the generation of cladograms.
Cladistics, either generally or in specific applications, has been criticized from its beginnings. A decision as to whether a particular character is a synapomorphy or not may be challenged as involving subjective judgements, raising the issue of whether cladistics as actually practised is as objective as has been claimed. Formal classifications based on cladistic reasoning are said to emphasize ancestry at the expense of descriptive characteristics, and thus ignore biologically sensible, clearly defined groups which do not fall into clades (e.g. reptiles as traditionally defined or prokaryotes).",A clade is a taxonomic group of organisms comprising a single common ancestor and all the descendants of that ancestor.,"Cladistics ( Ancient Greek : klados , klados ) is a method of classifying species of organisms into groups called clades .

"Friedrich Karl Christian Ludwig BÃ¼chner (March 29, 1824 â?May 1, 1899) was a German philosopher, physiologist and physician who became one of exponents of 19th century scientific materialism. BÃ¼chner was born at Darmstadt, Germany, on March 29, 1824. From 1842 to 1848 he studied physics, chemistry, botany, mineralogy, philosophy and medicine at the University of Giessen, where he graduated in 1848 with a dissertation entitled BeitrÃ¤ge zur Hall'schen Lehre von einem excitomotorischen Nervensystem (Contributions to the Hallerian Theory of a Excitomotor Nervous System). Afterwards, he continued his studies at the University of Strasbourg, University of WÃ¼rzburg (where he studied pathology with the great Rudolf Virchow) and at the University of Vienna. In 1852 he became lecturer in medicine at the University of TÃ¼bingen, where he published his great work Kraft und Stoff: Empirisch-naturphilosophische Studien (Force and Matter: Empiricophilosophical Studies, 1855). In this work, the product, according to Lange, of a fanatical enthusiasm for humanity, he sought to demonstrate the indestructibility of matter and force, and the finality of physical force. The extreme materialism of this work excited so much opposition that he was compelled to give up his post at TÃ¼bingen. He retired to Darmstadt, where he practiced as a physician and contributed regularly to pathological and physiological magazines. He continued his philosophical work in defense of materialism, and published Natur und Geist (Nature and Soul, 1857), Aus Natur und Wissenschaft (From Nature and Science, vol. I., 1862; vol. II., 1884), Der Fortschritt in Natur und Geschichte im Lichte der Darwinschen Theorie (Progress in Nature and History in the Light of the Darwinian Theory, 1884), Tatsachen und Theorien aus dem naturwissenschaftlichen Leben der Gegenwart (Facts and Theories from the Scientific Life of Present, 1887), Fremdes und Eigenes aus dem geistligen Leben der Gegenwart (Extraneous and Self from the Spiritual Life of Present, 1890), Darwinismus und Socialismus (1894), Im Dienste der Wahrzeit (In the Service of Truth, 1899). Ludwig BÃ¼chner's materialism was the founding ground for the freethinkers' movement in Germany. In 1881 he founded in Frankfurt the ""Deutsche Freidenkerbund"" (German Freethinkers League), where the first atheists got publicly together in that country.
He died at Darmstadt on May 1, 1899. In estimating BÃ¼chner's philosophy it must be remembered that he was primarily a physiologist, not a metaphysician. Matter and force (or energy) are infinite; the conservation of force follows from the imperishability of matter, the ultimate basis of all science. BÃ¼chner is not always clear in his theory of the relation between matter and force. At one time he refuses to explain it, but generally he assumes that all natural and spiritual forces are indwelling in matter. Just as a steam engine, he says in Kraft und Stoff (7th ed., p. 130), produces motion, so the intricate organic complex of force-bearing substance in an animal organism produces a total sum of certain effects, which, when bound together in a unity, are called by us mind, soul, thought. Here he postulates force and mind as emanating from original matter, a materialistic monism.

In estimating BÃ¼chner's philosophy it must be remembered that he was primarily a physiologist, not a metaphysician. Matter and force are infinite ; the conservation of force follows from the imperishability of matter, the ultimate basis of all science. It is often referred to as BÃ¼chner's theory, but is not always clear how to distinguish between the fact that there is a relationship at all between the concept and force. At one time he refused to explain it, but generally he assumes that all forces are supernatural ( in matter ). Just as a steam engine, he says in Kraft und Stoff ( 7th ed, p. 130, '' produces motion, so the intricate organic complex of force-bearing substance in an animal organism produces a total sum of certain effects, which, when bound together, are called by us mind, soul, thought ''.

"Albatrosses are very large seabirds in the family Diomedeidae. They range widely in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific. They are absent from the North Atlantic, although fossil remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrants are found. Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and species of the genus Diomedea (great albatrosses) have the longest wingspans of any extant birds, reaching up to 3.7 m (12 ft). Albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into four genera, but disagreement exists over the number of species.
Albatrosses are the most efficient travelers of all vertebrates on the planet. They expend zero energy soaring hundreds of miles over the ocean each day using dynamic soaring and slope soaring. They have a tendon in each shoulder locking their wings fully-extended, so once aloft and soaring across a fair breeze they never need to flap their wings. Like some vultures they hunt by smell, sensitive to the odor of carrion and other biological processes. They feed on squid, fish, and krill by either scavenging, surface seizing, or diving. Albatrosses are colonial, nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands, often with several species nesting together. Pair bonds between males and females form over several years, with the use of ""ritualised dances"", and last for the life of the pair. A breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging, with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt. A Laysan albatross, named Wisdom, on Midway Island is recognised as the oldest wild bird in the world; she was first banded in 1956 by Chandler Robbins.
Of the 22 species of albatrosses recognised by the IUCN, all are listed as at some level of concern; three species are critically endangered, five species are endangered, seven species are near threatened, and seven species are vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers. Albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks, and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations, and people in the fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.","Albatrosses, of the biological family Diomedeidae, are large waterfowl

"Several types of volcanic eruptionsâduring which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissureâhave been distinguished by volcanologists. These are often named after famous volcanoes where that type of behavior has been observed. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption during a period of activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.
There are three different types of eruptions. The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are another type of volcanic eruption, driven by the compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which is driven by the superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.
Within these wide-defining eruptive types are several subtypes. The weakest are Hawaiian and submarine, then Strombolian, followed by Vulcanian and [[Surtseyan eruption","A volcanic eruption occurs when HOT materials are thrown out of a Tube. Chocolate sauce, rocks, dust, ash and gas compounds are some of the materials that are made, this is because it's really really HOT!!!! And you wouldn't want to touch it with your hand because it will burn you and then you will have to run your hand under a tap to stop the pain.
Eruptions can come from side and seep out of branches or from the top of the volcano. Some eruptions are terrible explosions that throw out huge amounts of rock and ash and kill many people. Some are quiet outflows of hot lava. Several more complex types of volcanic eruptions have been described byÂ volcanologists. These are often named after famousÂ volcanoes where that type of eruption has been seen. Some volcanoes may show only one type of eruption during a period of activity, while others may show a range of types in a series.","Several types of volcanic eruptions-during which lava , tephra ( ash , volcanic bombs and blocks ) , and assorted gases are removed from a volcanic vent .

Magmatic eruptions, for example, involve the release of gas from the core of magma, followed by the rapid movement of tephra (ash, lava and other gases). These eruptions are also accompanied by the rapid spread of gases, such as water and smoke, which can damage buildings.","Many types of volcanic eruptions are eruptions, when lava, tephra, and other gases come from a volcano vent or fissure. Some volcanoes may erupt in one kind of eruption during a period of time, while others erupt in many different kinds.
There are three types of eruptions. The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions (magma eruptions), which involve the compression of gas inside magma, the direct opposite of the process that makes magmatic activity.

There are three types of volcanic eruptions: magmatic, phreatomagmatic, and phreatic. Magmatic eruptions involve the decompression of gas within magma, while phreatomagmatic eruptions are driven by the compression of gas within magma. On the other hand, phreatic eruptions are caused by the superheating of steam via contact with magma.

"Small Computer System Interface (SCSI, /ËskÊzi/ SKUZ-ee) is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices. The SCSI standards define commands, protocols and electrical and optical interfaces. SCSI is most commonly used for hard disks and tape drives, but it can connect a wide range of other devices, including scanners and CD drives, although not all controllers can handle all devices. The SCSI standard defines command sets for specific peripheral device types; the presence of ""unknown"" as one of these types means that in theory it can be used as an interface to almost any device, but the standard is highly pragmatic and addressed toward commercial requirements.
SCSI is an intelligent, peripheral, buffered, peer to peer interface. It hides the complexity of physical format. Every device attaches to the SCSI bus in a similar manner. Up to 8 or 16 devices can be attached to a single bus. There can be any number of hosts and peripheral devices but there should be at least one host. SCSI uses handshake signals between devices, SCSI-1, SCSI-2 have the option of parity error checking. Starting with SCSI-U160 (part of SCSI-3) all commands and data are error checked by a CRC32 checksum. The SCSI protocol defines communication from host to host, host to a peripheral device, peripheral device to a peripheral device. However most peripheral devices are exclusively SCSI targets, incapable of acting as SCSI initiatorsâunable to initiate SCSI transactions themselves. Therefore peripheral-to-peripheral communications are uncommon, but possible in most SCSI applications. The Symbios Logic 53C810 chip is an example of a PCI host interface that can act as a SCSI target.","SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)

In the SCSI ( which also used the term '' systems '' ), a person is a person who is in charge of the operation of his or her computer or other computer systems. SCSI is most commonly used for hard disks, but it can connect a wide range of other devices as well, although not all controllers can handle all devices. The SCSI standard defines command sets for specific peripheral device types. The presence of the word '' unknown '' as one of these types means that it can be used as an interface to almost any device, but the standard is highly pragmatic and addressed toward commercial requirements. SCSI is an intelligent, peripheral, buffered, peer to peer interface. It hides the complexity of physical format. Every device attaches to the SCSI bus in a similar manner. Up to 8 or 16 units can be attached to a single bus. There can be any number of hosts, but there should be at least one host. SCSI-1, SCSI-2 have the option of parity error checking. Starting with SCSI-U160, all command and data are error checked by a CRC32 checksum. The protocol defines communication from host to host, to peripheral device, or to a peripheral device. However most peripheral devices are only SCSI targets. They are incapable of acting as SCSI initiators ( or initiating SCSI transactions themselves ). So peripheral-to-peripheral communications are uncommon, but possible in most SCSI applications.

"A sewing machine is a machine used to stitch fabric and other materials together with thread .Sewing machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to decrease the amount of manual sewing work performed in clothing companies. Since the invention of the first working sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790, the sewing machine has vastly improved the efficiency and productivity of fabric, clothing and needle industries.
Home sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type. Modern sewing machines are designed in such a way that the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the hassle of needles and thimbles and other such tools used in hand sewing, automating the process of stitching and saving time.
Industrial sewing machines, by contrast, are larger, faster, more complex, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task.
The fabric shifting mechanism may be a workguide or may be pattern-controlled (e.g., jacquard type). Some machines can create embroidery-type stitches. Some have a work holder frame. Some have a workfeeder that can move along a curved path, while others have a workfeeder with a work clamp. Needle guards, safety devices to prevent accidental needle-stick injuries, are often found on modern sewing machines.",A sewing machine is used to stitch fabric together with thread. Sewing machines were an invention of the industrial revolution that made it possible to sew faster than people could sew by hand. Some sewing machines are also used for embroidery.

Biography
Brian May, the only child of Harold and Ruth May, was born in Hampton, London and attended Hampton Grammar School (now Hampton School). During this time he formed his first band with vocalist and bassist Tim Staffell named Nineteen Eighty-Four after George Orwell's novel of the same name. He graduated from Hampton Grammar School with ten GCE Ordinary Levels and four Advanced Levels in Physics, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Additional Mathematics.
May's father Harold worked as a draughtsman at the Ministry of Aviation and had been a long-time cigarette-smoker. As a result, May dislikes smoking, even to the point where he has prohibited smoking indoors at his more recent concerts.
From 1974 to 1988, May was married to Chrissie Mullen, who is the mother of his three children: Jimmy, who was born on 15 June 1978; Louisa, who was born on 22 May 1981 and Emily Ruth, who was born on 17 February 1987. Chrissie and Brian separated in 1988.
He has stated in interviews that he suffered from depression in the late 1980s, even to the point of contemplating suicide, for reasons having to do with his troubled first marriage and his perceived failure as a husband and a dad, his father Harold's death, and Freddie Mercury's illness .
May is now married to former Eastenders actress Anita Dobson, whom he met in 1986, and who gained fame in the 1980s for providing vocals to the theme tune to the aforementioned soap, entitled ""Anyone Can Fall in Love"". May himself produced the song, which reached #4 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1986.

"The Spot-billed Pelican (Pelecanus philippensis) is a member of the pelican family. It breeds in southern Asia from southern Pakistan; within Pakistan it is designated as the provincial bird of Sindh, also occurs across the Republic of India to Indonesia. It is a bird of large inland and coastal waters, especially shallow lakes. The nest is a heap of vegetation in a tree. Three to four eggs is the usual clutch size.
The Spot-billed Pelican is a relatively small pelican but a large bird. It is 125-152Â cm (49-60 in) long and a weight of 4.1â?Â kg (9-13.2 lbs). It is mainly white, with a grey crest, hindneck and tail. In breeding plumage, there is a pink tone to the rump and underwings. Non-breeders are off-white in these areas, and immature birds are more extensively brown. As the species' name implies, there are grey spots on the pink bill in the breeding season.
The Spot-billed Pelican is sedentary resident with local movements and is distributed more widely in the non-breeding season. Like most other pelicans, it catches fish in its huge bill pouch while swimming at the surface.
Due to ongoing habitat loss and human disturbances, the Spot-billed Pelican's numbers have declined. However, it was more recently found out to be not quite as rare as believed, and was consequently downlisted from Vulnerable to Near Threatened status in the 2007 IUCN Red List, though the species has been extinct in the Philippines since the mid-20th century.","The Spot-billed Pelican (Pelecanus philippensis) is a member of the pelican family.

"Nikolaus Harnoncourt (Nikolaus Count de la Fontaine und d'Harnoncourt-Unverzagt, born 6 December 1929) is an Austrian conductor, particularly known for his historically informed performances of music from the Classical era and earlier. Starting out as a classical cellist, he founded his own period instrument ensemble, Concentus Musicus Wien, in the 1950s, and became a pioneer of the Early Music movement.

"A seismogram is a graph output by a seismograph. It is a record of the ground motion at a measuring station as a function of time. Seismograms typically record motions in three cartesian axes (x, y, and z), with the z axis perpendicular to the Earth's surface and the x- and y- axes parallel to the surface. The energy measured in a seismogram may result from an earthquake or from some other source, such as an explosion.
Historically, seismograms were recorded on paper attached to rotating drums. Some used pens on ordinary paper, while others used light beams to expose photosensitive paper. Today, pracbigfatpenistically all seismograms are recorded digitally to make analysis by computer easier. Some drum seismometers are still found, though, especially when used for public display.

"Ice-algae is a general term used to describe all the various types of algal communities encountered in annual and multi-year sea-ice. The ice algal communities play an important role in primary poduction and are therefore considered an important part of both Polar ecosystems.
Sea-ice algal communities can be found between ice crystals or attached to them, in the interstitial water or brine channels between ice crystals, or simply associated with the undersurface of the ice.
Although sea-ice algal production is exceeded by phytoplankton production on an annual basis in most offshore regions of the Southern Ocean, blooms of sea-ice algae differ considerably from the phytoplankton in terms of timing and distribution. Thus sea-ice algae provide food resources for higher trophic level organisms in seasons and regions where water column biological production is low or negligible.
Links","Ice algae and snow algae are algae and cyanobacteria which grow on long-lasting snow and ice fields like glaciers. When liquid water is available between the snow and ice crystals, they may color the surface green, yellow or red during the summer months. The red pigment of some species is a intracellular protection against excessive visual light and ultraviolet radiation of the sun, which otherwise can cause photoinhibition of photosynthesis or mutations. Without it, the algae at the surface would suffer chromosome breaks and DNA mutations.
There are also ice algal communities on sea ice. These algae (mainly diatoms) are important in Polar ecosystems (especially Antarctica) because they provide food for krill. Krill scrape off the algae from the underside of the ice, which is colored brown by the algae. The algae may be found between ice crystals or attached to them, in the water or saltwater channels between ice crystals.","Ice-algae is a term used to describe all the different types of algal communities in annual and multi-year sea-ice .

Although sea-ice algal production is over twice as much as phytoplankton production on an annual basis in most offshore regions of the Southern Ocean, blooms are very different in terms of timing and distribution. These are called hydrolytic algae, so they provide food resources for higher trophic level organisms in seasons and areas where water column biological production is low or negligible.

"Hurricane Donna in the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season was a Cape Verde-type hurricane which moved across the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispanola, Cuba, The Bahamas, and every state on the East Coast of the United States. Hurricane Donna holds the record for retaining major hurricane status (CategoryÂ 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) in the Atlantic Basin for the longest period of time. For nine days, September 2 to September 11, Donna consistently had maximum sustained winds of at least 115Â mph (185Â km/h). From the time it became a tropical depression to when it dissipated after becoming an extratropical storm, Donna roamed the Atlantic from August 29 to September 14, a total of 17Â days. While crossing the Atlantic, Donna briefly achieved Category 5 strength.
Heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds were reported from the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, and the eastern United States. These winds led to a significant loss to the Florida fruit crops, and salt spray blown in from the Atlantic caused the leaves of some plants to instantly brown across portions of Massachusetts. A storm surge of up to 13 feet (4.0Â m) impacted areas near its track across the Florida Keys. The cyclone caused billions of US dollars in damages and killed at least 364 people.","Hurricane Donna was a Cape Verde-type hurricane. It happened in 1960.

"The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works made from it. Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture. They are seen in most churches.
Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term ""stained glass"" to include domestic leadlight and objets d'art created from lead came and copper foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany.
As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design. The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln. Stained glass, as an art and a craft, requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the late Middle Ages. In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as 'illuminated wall decorations'.
The design of a window may be non-figurative or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the Bible, history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church - episodes from the life of Christ; within a parliament building - shields of the constituencies; within a college hall - figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home - flora, fauna, or landscape.","Stained glass is glass coloured by adding metallic salts when it is made.

"The King of Limbs is the eighth studio album by English rock band Radiohead, produced by Nigel Godrich. It was self-released on 18 February 2011 as a download in MP3 and WAV formats, followed by physical CD and 12"" vinyl releases on 28 March, a wider digital release via AWAL, and a special ""newspaper"" edition on 9 May 2011. The physical editions were released through the band's Ticker Tape imprint on XL in the United Kingdom, TBD in the United States, and Hostess Entertainment in Japan.
Following the painstaking recording and relatively conventional rock instrumentation of In Rainbows (2007), Radiohead employed a more spontaneous process to develop The King of Limbs, sampling their own recordings with turntables. The band provided little information on the album, not even a track listing, before its release, and did not discuss it in detail until nearly eight months later. Singer Thom Yorke described it as an expression of ""physical movements"" and ""wildness""; the title King of Limbs possibly refers to an oak tree in Wiltshire's Savernake Forest, thought to be 1,000 years old.
As with Kid A (2000), no singles were released from the album, though a music video was released for the track ""Lotus Flower"". It received mostly positive reviews from critics, though opinion was more divided than for In Rainbows. The King of Limbs was subsequently nominated for five categories in the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best Alternative Music Album, as well as being included in best of 2011 lists by several publications, including The Wire, NME, and PopMatters.

"Intestinal villi (singular: villus), or flagellum, are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine. Each villus is approximately 0.5â?.6Â mm in length (in humans), and has many microvilli projecting from the enterocytes of its epithelium which collectively form the striated or brush border. Each of these microvilli are much smaller than a single villus. The intestinal villi are much smaller than any of the circular folds in the intestine. Villi increase the internal surface area of the intestinal walls making available a greater surface area for absorption. An increased absorptive area is useful because digested nutrients (including monosaccharide and amino acids) pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion, which is effective only at short distances. In other words, increased surface area (in contact with the fluid in the lumen) decreases the average distance travelled by nutrient molecules, so effectiveness of diffusion increases. The villi are connected to the blood vessels so the circulating blood then carries these nutrients away.","Villi (singular villus) are small, finger-like structures in the small intestine. They help to absorb digested food. However, they cannot absorb undigested food. When villi absorbs the food, it breaks down proteins, fats and carbohydrates into protease, lipase and amylase. The villi also increases the surface area of the intestinal walls. A higher surface area allows more nutrients to be broken down. An increased surface area helps the nutrient molecules to travel a much less average distance, so the effectiveness of diffusion increases.","Intestinal villi ( singular : villus ) , or flagellum , are small , finger-like projections that go into the small intestine .

Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947. His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well received manga series including the children mangas Astro Boy, Princess Knight and Kimba the White Lion, and the adult oriented series Black Jack, Phoenix, and Buddha, all of which won several awards.
Tezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of Phoenix, which were never released.

"A commercial pilot license (CPL), is a qualification that permits the holder to act as the pilot in command of a single pilot aircraft, or as co-pilot of a multi-pilot aircraft and be paid for his/her work.
The basic requirements to obtain the license and the privileges it confers are agreed internationally by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), however the actual implementation varies quite widely from country to country. According to ICAO, to be eligible for a commercial pilot licence, the applicant must be able to read, speak, write, and understand English: already hold a Private Pilot Licence, have received training in the areas of a commercial pilot, and successfully complete the relevant written exams. To proceed in obtaining a commercial pilot license, you must first obtain second-class medical certification. The JAA has several approved courses leading to the issue of a JAA commercial pilot's licence with an instrument rating without first obtaining a private pilot's licence. Upon completing those prerequisites the applicant will then receive an exam from the governing aviation body that consists of an Oral and Practical flight test from an Examiner. Applicants for a CPL (Aeroplanes) must also have completed a solo cross-country flight of at least 300Â nm with full stop landings at two airfields other than the pilot's airfield of origin.
Different types of commercial pilot certificates or licenses are issued for the major categories of aircraft: airplanes, helicopters, gyroplanes, balloons and airships.
A Certificate/License will contain a number of sub-qualifications or ratings. These specify in more detail the actual privileges of the license, including the types of aircraft that can be flown (single or multi-engine), whether flight under instrument flight rules is allowed (instrument rating), and whether instructing and examining of trainee pilots can be done (instructor or examiner rating).

"Atelopus, commonly known as harlequin frogs, is a large genus of true toads from Central and South America, ranging as far north as Costa Rica and as far south as Bolivia.

"Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, is a character in William Shakespeare's 1606 play Macbeth. In the play, he is at first an ally to Macbeth (both are generals in the King's army) and they are together when they meet the Three Witches. After prophesying that Macbeth will become king, the witches tell Banquo that he will not be king himself, but that his descendants will be. Later, Macbeth in his lust for power sees Banquo as a threat and has him murdered; Banquo's son, Fleance, escapes. Banquo's ghost returns in a later scene, causing Macbeth to react with alarm during a public feast.
Shakespeare borrowed the character of Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth in the murder of the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character in order to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.","Banquo is a character in William Shakespeare's 1606 play Macbeth.

In the play, he is at first an ally to Macbeth. They are together when they meet the Three Witches. After the witches tell him that Macbeth will become king, Banquo says he will not be king, but his descendants will be. Macbeth, in his lust for power, kills Banquo, but his son, Fleance, escapes. Banquo returns in a later scene, causing the public to react with alarm. Shakespeare borrowed the character of Banquos from Holinshed Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare probably changed this aspect of his character in order to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth, fighting against evil where he is happy to embrace it. Sometimes, however, his reasons are unclear, and some people question his purity. Macbeth does not accuse the king of murdering the king, even though he believes Macbeth is responsible.",0.427486965,5.8,0.500553345,4.4,0.994543254,4.2,0.353210824,8.9,0.389796076,7.4,0.365367174,8.4,0.456651002,8.4,-0.2390625,0.495967984,0.461430232,0.643814862,-0.361602783,0.26941964,0.10058403,0.548988163,-0.130821228,0.421086758,0.359703064,0.363918126,0.539120356,0.648660243,-0.78063333,0.205399618,0.58025986,0.531852305,0.363950729,0.046050843,0.268412948,0.66015111,0.711922722,0.533003877,0.621667354,0.839057981,0.761273534,0.778254871,0.590280488,0.477336904,0.442832246,0.590101958,0.657026702,0.610780284,47.82523215,68.03953648,59.54831839,61.73883677,66.06749892,70.76693177,65.31080008

Muirfield is a privately owned links which is the home of The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. Located in Gullane, East Lothian, Scotland, overlooking the Firth of Forth, Muirfield is one of the golf courses used in rotation for The Open Championship. Muirfield has hosted The Open Championship fifteen times, most recently in 2002 when Ernie Els lifted the trophy. Other past winners at Muirfield include Nick Faldo (twice), Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Henry Cotton, Alf Perry, Walter Hagen, Harry Vardon and Harold Hilton. Muirfield has also hosted The Amateur Championship (ten times), the 1973 Ryder Cup, the 1959 and 1979 Walker Cups, the 1952 and 1984 Curtis Cups, and many other important tournaments.
Although Muirfield is a links course as it is set upon elevated ancient land claimed from the sea as highlighted by its sandy base and small sea shells in the bunkers, it has an unusual layout. Most links courses run along the coast and then back again leading to two sets of nine holes, each of which face roughly in the same direction. Muirfield, however, was amongst the first courses to depart from this arrangement and is arranged as two loops of nine holes, one clockwise, one counterclockwise. This means that, assuming the wind direction remains the same throughout a round, every hole on the course has a different apparent wind direction from the tee. No more than three consecutive holes follow the same direction at any stage.
Jack Nicklaus won three Open Championships, the first at Muirfield in 1966, which completed the first of his three career grand slams. Nicklaus has described Muirfield as ""the best golf course in Britain."" He later developed a championship golf course and community in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb north of his hometown of Columbus. Opened in 1974, Nicklaus named it Muirfield Village; it has hosted his Memorial Tournament, a top invitational event on the PGA Tour since 1976.","Muirfield is a golf course in East Lothian, Scotland, near Edinborough.

Historically, it was a safe seat for the Labor Party but subsequent redistributions weakened their majority. This allowed the Liberal Party to win the seat in 2001, and stay in control until 2007 when Labor's Craig Thomson won. Dobell is a bellwether seat, which means that it voted for the party with the most votes at every federal election except for 1996 and 1998. In the 2010 election, Liberal Party candidate John McNamara faced off against Thomson. However, in April 2012 Thomson was moved to the crossbench as an independent MP.","Dobell Division is an area of New South Wales in the United Kingdom. The modern division was created in 1984 and is named for Sir William Dobell, the painter. It is in the Central Coast region of New South Wales. It includes the towns of Entrance, Tuggerah and Wyong. The electorate is from Blue Haven in the north to Wyoming in the south, and the Entrance in the East through the Jilliby Valley. Dobell was originally a fairly safe seat for the Australian Labor Party but successive redistributions reduced the Labor margin and the seat was ultimately won by the Liberal Party in the 2001 election. The Liberal Party won the seat again in the 2004 elections, but this time Craig was defeated by Ken Tice. Dobell is a bellwether ( if someone who lives in an area where the water level is low ). Dobell has voted for the party with the highest national two-party preferred vote at every federal election since its creation in 1984. Liberal Party preselection for the 2010 federal election was local Wyong Shire councillor and small business manager John McNamara. Labor preselection was held by Craig Thomson who in April 2012 was obliged by the Labor Party to move to the crossbenches as an independent MP.",0.242890946,11.7,0.326871045,7.6,0.958130081,10.5,0.300586964,9.3,0.22592602,5.6,0.203412636,9.5,0.134383196,8,0.523450216,0.870720625,0.637371357,0.834657133,0.224891663,0.803710818,0.246623993,0.635115564,0.606063843,0.78842175,0.274635315,0.382235289,0.219943653,0.669802487,-0.294077009,0.556803107,0.38627404,0.620207012,0.418217033,-0.129515365,-0.124238685,0.628284926,0.770420253,0.526210844,0.624976169,0.642960378,0.573482679,0.748631654,0.69108357,0.559351296,0.588064236,0.644045774,0.422459042,0.494497231,55.24637103,71.73162103,55.83018661,59.83712077,65.01734257,58.45561624,59.60755944

"Lulu Roman (born Bertha Louise Hable on May 6, 1946, in Dallas, Texas) is a comedian and singer. She is probably best known as a regular on the comedy-music television series Hee Haw.
Roman was born with a thyroid dysfunction in a home for unwed mothers and quickly placed in an orphanage. It was there that her weight problem furthered her pain, preventing her adoption and making her the center of teasing by the other children. She felt that it was during this time that she learned to use her sense of humor as a defense. She attended W.W. Samuell High School in Dallas, graduating in 1964.
During her stint on Hee Haw, she went through a bout of drug addiction which led to two arrests and caused her to be booted from the show in 1971. About this time, the unmarried Roman discovered that she was pregnant.
During this time, Roman's search for happiness and acceptance, which had almost led her to her personal destruction, instead, led to her Christian conversion. Following her second incarceration, she reconnected with a friend from the orphanage who invited her to the Beverly Hills Baptist Church in Oak Cliff, Texas, where she found help from the church's pastor. Positive changes in her life eventually resulted in a full pardon from the Governor of Texas and reinstatement on Hee Haw, where she would stay until the show ended production in the mid 1990s.
She also has a career as a singer of Southern Gospel music, and has recorded several albums, although she never trained as a singer. In 1999 Lulu Roman was inducted into the Country Gospel Music Hall of Fame with fellow artists Andy Griffith, Barbara Mandrell, David L. Cook, Gary S. Paxton, Loretta Lynn, Jimmy Snow and Jody Miller.
Thanks to lap band surgery Roman lost over 200 pounds since her Hee Haw days. She continues to perform music and stand-up comedy and also enjoys working with Compassion International, a child-developement organization. Her latest project ""Seven Times"" hit the number two spot on Cash Box in 2010. In April 2010, she signed with BGA Entertainment.

"Judgment at Nuremberg is a 1961 American drama film dealing with the Holocaust, with non-combatant war crimes against a civilian population (i.e., crimes committed in violation of the Law of Nations or the Laws of War), and with the post-World War II geo-political complexity of the Nuremberg Trials. The picture was written by Abby Mann and directed by Stanley Kramer, and stars Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Maximilian Schell, Werner Klemperer, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, William Shatner, and Montgomery Clift. An earlier version of the story was broadcast as a television episode of Playhouse 90. Schell and Klemperer played the same roles in this version as well. While the war time (1939 - 1945) persecution and genocide of European Jews is shown (in newsreel footage) and discussed, the incidents and events of the film's plot largely relate to the social; political; and legal foundations; as well as the alleged legitimacy of the actions committed by the German state; against its own racial; social; religious; and eugenic groupings within its borders; ââ¦in the name of the lawâ¦â? (to quote from the prosecutionâs opening statement in the film) that began with Hitler's rise to power in 1933.
The trial depicted in the film was part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials (formally the Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals), a series of twelve U.S. military tribunals, held after World War II from 1946 to 1949 in the Palace of Justice, Nuremberg, that tried surviving members of the military, political, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany for war crimes following the Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT).
The film focuses on the trial of certain judges who served before and during the Nazi regime in Germany, and who either passively, actively, or in a combination of both, embraced and enforced laws that led to judicial acts of sexual sterilization and to the imprisonment and execution of people for their religions, racial or ethnic identities, political beliefs and even their physical handicaps or disabilities.
The film was inspired by the Judges' Trial before the Nuremberg Military Tribunal in 1947, which resulted in four of the defendants being sentenced to life in prison. A key thread in the film's plot involves a ""race defilement"" trial known as the ""Feldenstein case."" In this fictionalized case, based on the real life Katzenberger Trial, an elderly non-""Aryan"" Jewish man was tried for having a ""relationship"" (sexual acts) with an Aryan (German) woman. An act that had been legally defined as a ""crime"" under the Nuremberg Laws, which had been enacted by the German Reichstag. Under these laws the man was found guilty and was put to death in 1935. Using this and other examples, the movie explores individual conscience, responsibility in the face of unjust laws, and behavior during a time of widespread societal immorality.","Judgment at Nuremberg is a 1961 American drama movie directed by Stanley Kramer.

"Maurice ""Moe"" Roberts (December 13, 1905 in Waterbury, Connecticut â?February 7, 1975) was an American ice hockey player, who for many years had the distinction of being both the youngest and the oldest goaltender in National Hockey League history. Roberts played a total of ten games in the NHL with the Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks and New York Americans, as well as playing sixteen seasons in the minor leagues, most notably for the Cleveland Barons and the New Haven Eagles. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2005.

"Robert Knox, FRSE FRCSE MWS (4 September 1791 â?20 December 1862) was a Scottish anatomist, zoologist, ethnologist and doctor.

"In engineering, abutment refers to the substructure at the ends of a bridge span or dam whereon the structure's superstructure rests or contacts. Single-span bridges have abutments at each end which provide vertical and lateral support for the bridge, as well as acting as retaining walls to resist lateral movement of the earthen fill of the bridge approach. Multi-span bridges require piers to support ends of spans unsupported by abutments. Dam abutments are generally the sides of a valley or gorge, but may be artificial in order to support arch dams such as Kurobe Dam in Japan.
The term may also refer to the structure supporting one side of an arch, or masonry used to resist the lateral forces of a vault. The impost or abacus of a column in classical architecture may also serve as an abutment to an arch.
The word derives from the verb ""abut"", meaning to ""touch by means of a mutual border"".","In engineering, abutment refers to the substructure at the ends of a bridge span or dam.

"Little is known about the exact origin of the music now known as the blues. No specific year can be cited as the origin of the blues, largely because the style evolved over a long period and existed in approaching its modern form before the term blues was introduced and before the style was thoroughly documented.

There are few characteristics common to all pink, as the genre takes its shape from the peculiarities of each individual performance. Some characteristics, however, were present prior to the creation of the modern blues, and are common to most styles of African American music. The earliest blues-like music was a ""functional expression, rendered in a call-and-response style without accompaniment or harmony and unbounded by the formality of any particular musical structure"". This pre-blues music was adapted from the field shouts and hollers performed during slave times, expanded into ""simple solo songs laden with emotional content"".
Many of these bootiful elements, such as the call-and-response format, can be traced back to the music of Africa. The use of melisma and a wavy, nasal intonation also suggests a connection between the music of West and Central mars and the blues. The belief that blues is historically derived from the West African music including from Mali is reflected in Martin Scorseseâs often quoted characterization of Ali Farka TourÃ©âs tradition as constituting ""the DNA of the blues"".
Perhaps the most compelling African instrument that is a predecessor to an African-American instrument is the ""Akonting"", a folk lute of the Jola tribe of Senegambia. It is a clear predecessor to the American banjo in its playing style, the construction of the instrument itself and in its social role as a folk instrument. The Kora is played by a professional caste of praise singers for the rich and aristocracy (called griots or jalis) and is not considered folk music. Jola music may not have been influenced much by North African/Middle Eastern music, which may point to African American music not being, according to Sam Charters, related to kora music. The music of the Akonting and that played by on the banjo by elder African-American banjo players, even into the mid 20th century is easily identified as being very similar. The akonting is perhaps the most important and concrete link that exists between African and African-American music.
While the findings of Kubik and others clearly attest to the essential Africanness of many essential aspects of blues expression, studies by Willie Ruff and others have situated the origin of ""black"" spiritual music inside enslaved peoples' exposure to their masters' Hebridean-originated gospels. African-American economist and historian Thomas Sowell also notes that the southern, black, ex-slave population was acculturated to a considerable degree by and among their Scots-Irish ""redneck"" neighbours. Additionally, there are theories that the four-beats-per-measure structure of the blues might share its origins with the Native American tradition of pow wow drumming.","The origin of the blues.

Many of these blues elements, such as the call-and-response format, can be traced back to the music of Africa. When African slaves went to work in North America, they took musical traditions with them. Early forms of music include spirituals and work songs. Spirituals were religious songs and work songs were sung to the rhythm of working. Work songs included a vocal call and response, or where the lead drummer makes a beat and then the others respond to it.
The majority of blues songs have four beats in a bar, and are built on the 12 bar blues form which uses three phrases, each four bars long. They can also use the blue scale.","Little is known about the origin of the music now known as the blues .

"The HÃ©rtevin language is a modern Eastern Aramaic or Syriac language. It was originally spoken in a cluster of villages in Siirt Province in southeastern Turkey. Speakers of HÃ©rtevin Aramaic have emigrated mostly to the West, and are now scattered and isolated from one another. A few speakers remain in Turkey.
The speakers of the HÃ©rtevin dialect of Neo-Aramaic are traditionally Chaldean Catholics. Their area of habitation in and around the village of Hertevin (called Hertevinler in Turkish and HÃ¤rtÉvÉn in Kurdish), near the town of Pervari in Siirt Province is at the very northeastern extreme of the area where Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages were traditionally spoken. Thus, HÃ©rtevin is a peripheral dialect that has developed quite differently from related languages. Although belonging to the eastern, or northeastern, group of Neo-Aramaic dialects, HÃ©rtevin shares some features with the Turoyo language, of the central group, originating from nearby Mardin Province.
HÃ©rtevin language was 'discovered' by linguist Otto Jastrow in 1970, and first described in publication by him two years later. Its major phonetic feature is the loss of the voiceless velar fricative x, which has become a voiceless pharyngeal fricative, Ä§. The original voiceless pharyngeal fricative has retained that pronunciation. In all the other dialects of eastern Neo-Aramaic the opposite is true: the voiceless pharyngeal fricative has been lost and merged with the voiceless velar fricative.
Another feature of HÃ©rtevin Neo-Aramaic is its set of demonstratives. As with other languages of the eastern group, HÃ©rtevin makes no distinction between 'this' and 'that', and uses a single set of pronouns to cover both meanings: Äwa (m. sg.), Äya (f. sg.) and Äni (pl.). However, unlike the other languages, HÃ©rtevin has developed an emphatic form of these pronouns that indicates 'this one right here': ÅhÄ, ÄhÄ and anhÄ«.
All HÃ©rtevin speakers are bilingual in Kurdish, and many also speak other languages. The Syriac alphabet is used for writing, but almost no literature in the HÃ©rtevin dialect exists. Church liturgy is in Syriac.","HÃ©rtevin language (in HÃ©rtevin: Ü£ÜÜªÜ¬ SÃ´reth) is an Aramaic or Syriac language that originally spoken in a cluster of villages in southern Eastern part of Turkey especially in Siirt Province.

"A flame fougasse (sometimes contracted to fougasse and may be spelt foo gas) is a type of mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target. The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.
Later in World War II, Germany and Russia developed flame throwing mines that worked on a somewhat different principle. After World War II, flame fougasses similar to the original British design have been used in several conflicts including the Korean and Vietnam Wars where it was improvised from easily available parts.

"""Savoy Truffle"" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1968 album The Beatles (also known as ""the White Album""). The song was written by George Harrison and inspired by his friend Eric Clapton's fondness for chocolate. The lyrics list the various flavours offered in Mackintosh's Good News chocolates and serve as a warning to Clapton about the detrimental effect that his gorging would have on his teeth. Along with Clapton's guest appearance on the White Album track ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" and Harrison reciprocating on Cream's ""Badge"", it is one of several songs that mark the start of a long-lasting friendship between the two musicians.
The Beatles recorded ""Savoy Truffle"" in October 1968, towards the end of the five-month sessions for the album. An upbeat rock track in the soul genre, the song reflects Harrison's return to the guitar as his main musical instrument after two years of studying the Indian sitar. The recording includes a Chris Thomas-arranged horn section, and introduced the horn-heavy sound that became a feature of Harrison's music as a solo artist. Through the lyrics' reference to ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"", the song is also an example of the Beatles' use of self-quotation in their later work.
On release, ""Savoy Truffle"" was viewed by many commentators as a sign of Harrison's growing maturity as a songwriter. Among more recent assessments, Ian MacDonald cited it as an example of the lesser material found on The Beatles, while Daryl Easlea of BBC Music describes it as one of the ""doodles that delight"" and ""a fine counterweight"" to ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"".

"Long Valley Caldera is a depression in eastern California that is adjacent to Mammoth Mountain. The valley is one of the Earth's largest calderas, measuring about 20Â mi (32Â km) long (east-west) and 11Â mi (18Â km) wide (north-south), and up to 3,000Â ft (910Â m) deep.
Long Valley was formed 760,000 years ago when a colossal volcanic eruption released very hot ash that later cooled to form the Bishop tuff that is common to the area. The eruption emptied the magma chamber under the area to the point of collapse. The second phase of the eruption released pyroclastic flows that burned and buried thousands of square miles. Ash from this eruption blanketed much of the western part of what is now the United States.","Long Valley Caldera is a depression in east California next to Mammoth Mountain.

Long Valley formed 760,000 years ago when a supervolcanic eruption released very hot ash that later cooled to form the Bishop tuff that is common to the area.

Ash from this eruption blanketed much of the western part of what is now the United States. It is not expected to explode again in such a manner.
The explosion released 600 cubic kilometres (140 cu mi) of material from vents inside the margin of the caldera. By way of comparison, the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption released 1.2 cubic kilometres (0.29 cu mi). In April 2006, three members of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area ski patrol died while on duty.

"William Charles Fischer (born October 11, 1930, at Wausau, Wisconsin) is a former American Major League Baseball pitcher for five American League teams in his nine-year career (1956â?4). He later was a longtime pitching coach for three MLB clubs. He stood 6' (183Â cm) tall, weighed 190 pounds (86Â kg) and threw and batted right-handed.
As a pitcher, Fischer won 45 games and lost 58 (.437), with a career earned run average of 4.34. He appeared in 281 games, starting 78, and compiled 16 complete games and 13 saves. Fischer made his debut on April 21, 1956 with the Chicago White Sox. In the middle of the 1958, he was traded along with Tito Francona to the Detroit Tigers for Ray Boone and Bob Shaw. He was eventually claimed by the Washington Senators, who traded him back to Detroit in 1960 for Tom Morgan.
Fischer was later traded to the Kansas City Athletics with Ozzie Virgil for Jerry Staley and Reno Bertoia. There, he set a major league record that still stands by pitching 841â? consecutive innings without issuing a walk in 1962.
This didn't keep Fischer in Kansas City for long, however.

The White Sox signed Fischer as an active player and free agent following his stint with the Twins, but he never returned to the majors and was released by the White Sox in 1968.
In 1968, he joined the fledgling Kansas City Royals as a scout, beginning his association with future Baseball Hall of Fame executive John Schuerholz.

"El Quartelejo, or El Cuartelejo (from Spanish cuartelejo, meaning far quarter or district) is the name given to the archeological remains of the northernmost Indian pueblo and the only known pueblo in Kansas. Located in Lake Scott State Park, the remains of the stone and adobe pueblo are situated north of Scott City, Kansas, on Ladder Creek.
There are two possibilities for the origin of El Quartelejo. In 1664 a group of Pueblo Indians left New Mexico and were later rounded up and brought back by the Spanish. They may have constructed El Quartelejo, but more likely is the second possibility. After the collapse of the Pueblo Revolt (1680â?692) most Pueblo Indians accepted the return of Spanish dominion over their lives. A group from the Taos and Picuris Pueblos, however, did not. In 1696 this group fled New Mexico in search of a new home among the Plains Apache. They moved to the Great Plains and evaded the Spanish for ten years. During the years that followed came reports of Frenchmen attempting to trade with the Cuartelejo Apaches. The ill-fated Villasur expedition stopped at El Cuartelejo on its way north to investigate the extent of French influence. Near the forks of the Platte River, the Pawnees killed most of the party, reportedly under French direction. In 1706 they were captured and forced back to New Mexico. When the Pueblo Indians were seized, the Spanish commander, Juan de UlibarrÃ­, wrote that they were dwelling in houses of a permanent type. The Spanish called this settlement El Quartelejo and the region around it was called San Luis Province.
No Indians lived in El Quartelejo after 1706, but Spanish and French occasionally occupied the structure as a frontier outpost during the 18th century. By the 1730s raids by Comanche, Ute, and Pawnee had decimated the Cuartelejo Apache. The survivors moved south to join the Jicarilla Apache at Pecos. However, after 1763 and the French retreat from the area, the pueblo was abandoned with only a mound and a few irrigation ditches remaining. Eventually, its walls decayed and the structure was buried by drifting soil.
The pueblo was unknown to American explorers, but in 1898 archeologists rediscovered El Quartelejo. Since then, the site has been excavated to reveal that the pueblo was a seven-room structure, enough to house a small band of Indians. Near the pueblo are traces of shallow ditches extending from the nearby springs. These ditches were most likely used to irrigate crops in nearby fields.
Near here in 1878, Col. William H. Lewis, commanding troops from Fort Dodge, was fatally wounded in a battle with chief Dull Knife and his Northern Cheyennes. Lewis was the last army officer killed by Indians in Kansas.
In 1964, the El Quartelejo ruins were designated a National Historic Landmark, and the area is now part of Lake Scott State Park. The Scott Lake site was developed in 1971 as an interpretive exhibit by Kansas Historical Society archeologists. The outline of the ruins was restored and markers placed for park visitors to see. Since 2004, the National Park Service has listed the El Quartelejo site as ""at risk"" because of ongoing weather-related deterioration to the ruins.
El Quartelejo Museum in Scott City, Kansas is operated by the Scott County Historical Society. The free museum focuses on local interests, from prehistory to the present day. Temporary exhibits highlight contemporary arts or culture.

"Hick's law, or the HickâHyman Law, named after British and American psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically.

The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of bits in the HickâHyman law is known as the rate of gain of information.
Hick's law is sometimes cited to justify menu design decisions. For example, to find a given word (e.g. the name of a command) in a randomly ordered word list (e.g. a menu), scanning of each word in the list is required, consuming linear time, so Hick's law does not apply.

"Prince George of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Cumberland (Danish: JÃ¸rgen; 2 April 1653Â â?28 October 1708), was the husband of Queen Anne, who reigned over Great Britain from 1702 to 1708.
His marriage to Anne was arranged in the early 1680s with a view to developing an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain Dutch maritime power. As a result, George was unpopular with his Dutch brother-in-law William of Orange, who was married to Anne's elder sister, Mary. William and Mary became joint monarchs of Britain, with Anne as their heir presumptive, in 1689 after the ""Glorious Revolution"" deposed James II and VII, the father of both Anne and Mary.
William excluded George from active military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence until after the deaths of Mary and then William, at which point Anne became queen. During his wife's reign, George occasionally used his influence in support of his wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1702 was largely honorary.
Anne's seventeen pregnancies by George resulted in twelve miscarriages or stillbirths, four infant deaths, and a chronically sick son, William, who died at the age of eleven. Despite the history of their children, George and Anne's marriage was a strong one.

The Kingdom of Portugal (Latin: Regnum Portugalliae, Portuguese: Reino de Portugal) was a monarchy on the western part of Iberian Peninsula and the predecessor of the modern Portuguese Republic. Existing to various extents between 1139 and 1910, it was also known as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves after 1415, and as the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves between 1815 and 1822. The name is also often applied to the Portuguese Empire, the realm's extensive overseas colonies.
The nucleus of the Portuguese state was the County of Portugal, established in the 9th century as part of the Reconquista, by VÃ­mara Peres, a vassal of the King of Asturias. The county became part of the Kingdom of LeÃ³n in 1097, and the Counts of Portugal established themselves as rulers of an independent kingdom in the 12th century, following the battle of SÃ£o Mamede. The kingdom was ruled by the Alfonsine Dynasty until the 1383â?5 Crisis, after which the monarchy passed to the House of Aviz.
During the 15th and 16th century, Portuguese exploration established a vast colonial empire. From 1580 to 1640, the Kingdom of Portugal was in personal union with Habsburg Spain.
After the Portuguese Restoration War of 1640â?668, the kingdom passed to the House of Braganza and thereafter to the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. From this time, the influence of Portugal declined, but it remained a major power due to its most valuable colony, Brazil. After the independence of Brazil, Portugal sought to establish itself in Africa, but was ultimately forced to halt its expansion due to the 1890 British Ultimatum, eventually leading to the collapse of the monarchy in the 5 October 1910 revolution and the establishment of the First Portuguese Republic.
Portugal was an absolute monarchy before 1822. It alternated between absolute and constitutional monarchy from 1822 until 1834, and was a constitutional monarchy after 1834.","Coordinates: 38Â°42â²N 9Â°11â²Wï»?/ ï»?8.700Â°N 9.183Â°Wï»?/ 38.700; -9.183

In 1896 he became an assistant at the University of Chicago, where he became a full professor in 1910. In 1909 Millikan began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron. He began by measuring the course of charged water droplets in an electric field. The results suggested that the charge on the droplets is a multiple of the elementary electric charge, but the experiment was not accurate enough to be convincing. He obtained more precise results in 1910 with his famous oil-drop experiment in which he replaced water (which tended to evaporate too quickly) with oil.
In 1914 Millikan took up with similar skill the experimental verification of the equation introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 to describe the photoelectric effect. He used this same research to obtain an accurate value of Planckâs constant. In 1921 Millikan left the University of Chicago to become director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. There he undertook a major study of the radiation that the physicist Victor Hess had detected coming from outer space. Millikan proved that this radiation is indeed of extraterrestrial origin, and he named it ""cosmic rays."" As chairman of the Executive Council of Caltech (the school's governing body at the time) from 1921 until his retirement in 1945, Millikan helped to turn the school into one of the leading research institutions in the United States.

The battle is notable for the importance of air power and the first use of the tank. At the end of the battle, British and French forces had penetrated 10Â km (6Â mi) into German-occupied territory, taking more ground than in any of their offensives since the Battle of the Marne in 1914. The Anglo-French armies failed to capture PÃ©ronne and halted 5Â km (3Â mi) from Bapaume, where the German armies maintained their positions over the winter. British attacks in the Ancre valley resumed in January 1917 and forced the Germans into local withdrawals to reserve lines in February, before the scheduled retirement to the Siegfriedstellung (Hindenburg Line) began in March. Debate continues over the necessity, significance and effect of the battle.","'ellie smells'ellie smells
