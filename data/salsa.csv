"A paperback (also known as softback or softcover) is a type of book characterized by a thick paper or cardboard cover, and often held together with glue rather than stitches or staples. In contrast, hardcover or hardback books are bound with cardboard covered with cloth; although more expensive, hardbacks are more durable. Inexpensive books bound in paper have existed since at least the 19th century in such forms as pamphlets, yellowbacks, dime novels, and airport novels. Most modern paperbacks are either ""mass-market paperbacks"" or ""trade paperbacks"".
Paperback editions of books are issued when a publisher decides to release a book in a low-cost format. Cheap paper, glued bindings, and the lack of a hard cover contribute to the inherent low cost of paperbacks. Paperbacks can be the preferred medium when a book is not expected to be a major seller, or in other situations where the publisher wishes to release a book without putting forth a large investment. Examples include many novels, and newer editions or reprintings of older books.
Since hardcovers tend to have a larger profit margin, publishers must balance the profit to be made by selling fewer hardcovers against the potential profit to be made by selling many paperbacks with a smaller profit per unit. First editions of many modern books, especially genre fiction, are issued in paperback. Best-selling books, on the other hand, may maintain sales in hardcover for an extended period in order to reap the greater profits that the hardcovers provide.","A paperback is a type of book.

"Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 â 24 March 1603) was Queen of England and Queen of Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death. Sometimes called The Virgin Queen, Gloriana or Good Queen Bess, Elizabeth was the sixth and last monarch of the Tudor dynasty. The daughter of Henry VIII, she was born a princess, but her mother, Anne Boleyn, was executed three years after her birth, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Perhaps for that reason, her brother, Edward VI, cut her out of the succession. His will, however, was set aside, as it contravened the Third Succession Act of 1543, in which Elizabeth was named as successor provided that Mary I of England, Elizabeth's half-sister, should die without issue. In 1558, Elizabeth succeeded Mary, during whose reign she had been imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels. Elizabeth set out to rule by good counsel, and she depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by William Cecil, Baron Burghley. One of her first moves was to support the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the Supreme Governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement held firm throughout her reign and later evolved into today's Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry, but despite several petitions from parliament, she never did. The reasons for this choice are unknown, and they have been much debated. As she grew older, Elizabeth became famous for her virginity, and a cult grew up around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants and literature of the day. In government, Elizabeth was more conservative than her father and siblings. One of her mottos was video et taceo: ""I see, and say nothing"". This strategy, viewed with impatience by her counsellors, often saved her from political and martial misalliances. Though Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs and only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France and Ireland, the defeat of the Spanish armada in 1588 associated her name forever with what is popularly viewed as one of the greatest victories in British history. Within twenty years of her death, she was being celebrated as the ruler of a golden age, an image that retains its hold on the English people. Elizabeth's reign is known as the Elizabethan era, famous above all for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake and slave-trader John Hawkins.
Historians, however, tend to be more cautious in their assessment. They often depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity to the point where many of her subjects were relieved at her death. Elizabeth is however acknowledged by historians as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor, in an age when government was ramshackle and limited and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. Such was the case with Elizabeth's rival, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom she imprisoned in 1568 and eventually executed in 1587. After the short reigns of Elizabeth's brother and sister, her forty-five years on the throne provided valuable stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.","Mary I had made the nation Catholic, but Elizabeth'

"In particle physics, antimatter is material composed of antiparticles, which have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but have opposite charge and other particle properties such as lepton and baryon number. Encounters between particles and antiparticles lead to the annihilation of both, giving rise to varying proportions of high-energy photons (gamma rays), neutrinos, and lower-mass particleâantiparticle pairs. Setting aside the mass of product neutrinos, the end result of annihilation is a release of energy proportional to the mass in accord with the mass-energy equivalence equation, E=mc2.
Antiparticles bind with each other to form antimatter in just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) and an antiproton can form an antihydrogen atom. Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements. To date, however, anti-atoms more complex than antihelium have neither been artificially produced nor observed in nature.

"Allan Kardec was a pseudonym of Hippolyte LÃ©on Denizard Rivail (October 3, 1804 - March 31, 1869), compiler or codifier of the Spiritism.
Rivail was born in Lyon, France, in 1804. A disciple and collaborator of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, he spoke several languages and taught mathematics, astronomy, physiology, French, physics, chemistry and comparative anatomy. He was already in his early fifties when he became interested in the wildly popular phenomenon of spirit-tapping. At the time, strange phenomena attributed to the action of spirits were reported in many different places, most notably in the U.S. and France, attracting the attention of high society. The first such phenomena were at best frivolous and entertaining, featuring objects that moved or ""tapped"" under what was said to be spirit control. In some cases, this was alleged to be a type of communication: the supposed spirits answered questions by controlling the movements of objects so as to pick out letters to form words, or simply indicate ""yes"" or ""no.""
At the time, Franz Mesmer's theory of animal magnetism was popular in the upper reaches of society. When confronted with the phenomena described, many researchers including Rivail pointed out that animal magnetism might explain them. Rivail, however, after personally seeing a demonstration, quickly dismissed the animal-magnetism hypothesis as being insufficient to completely explain all the facts observed. Rivail was determined to understand exactly what was causing the physical effects popularly attributed to spirits.
As an academic with a solid scientific background, Rivail decided to do his own research. Not being a medium, he compiled a list of questions and began working with mediums and channelers to pose them to spirits. Soon the quality of communication with spirits appeared to improve markedly. In 1857 Rivail (signing himself ""Allan Kardec"") published his first book on Spiritism, The Spirits Book. It comprised a series of 1,018 questions exploring matters concerning the nature of spirits, the spirit world, and the relations between the spirit world and the material world. This was followed by a series of other books, like The Book on Mediums and The Gospel According to Spiritism, and by a periodical, the Revue Spirite, which Kardec published until his death.

At the time, strange phenomena were reported in many places, most notably in the U.S. and France, attracting the attention of high society. The first such phenomena were called '' fun and entertaining '' ( not '' things that moved '' ) under what was said to be spirit control. In some cases, this was alleged to be a type of communication : the supposed spirits answered questions by controlling the movements of objects so as to pick out letters to form words, or simply to say '' yes '' or '' no ''. At the time, MesmerÃ¢ s theory of animalism was very popular in the upper reaches of society. When confronted with this phenomenon, many researchers, such as Rivail, pointed out that animal magnetism might explain them. Rivail, however, after personally seeing a demonstration, quickly dismissed the animal-magnetism hypothesis as being insufficient to completely explain all the facts observed. Rivail tried to understand exactly what was causing the physical effects. Many people think these effects are related to spirits. As an academic with a strong background, Rivail decided to do his own research. He made a list of questions and began working with mediums and channelers to pose them to spirits. Later the quality of communication with spirits started to improve markedly. Allan Kardec published an early book called '' The Book of the Spirits '' in 1857.

"The Spanish Civil War[nb 2] was fought from 17 July 1936 to 1 April 1939 between the Republicans, who were loyal to the established Spanish Republic, and the Nationalists, a rebel group led by General Francisco Franco. The Nationalists prevailed, and Franco ruled Spain for the next 36 years, from 1939 until his death in 1975. The war began after a pronunciamiento (declaration of opposition) by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces under the leadership of JosÃ© Sanjurjo against the elected government of the Second Spanish Republic, at the time under the leadership of President Manuel AzaÃ±a. The rebel coup was supported by a number of conservative groups, including the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right,[nb 3] monarchists such as the religious conservative Carlists, and the Fascist Falange.[nb 4]
The coup was supported by military units in Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos, Valladolid, CÃ¡diz, Cordova, and Seville. However, rebelling units in important cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, and MÃ¡laga were unable to capture their objectives, and those cities remained in control of the government. Spain was thus left militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists, now led by General Francisco Franco, and the Republican government fought it out for the control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions and soldiers from Nazi Germany, the Italy, while the Soviet Union and Mexico intervened in support of the ""Loyalist"", or ""Republican"", side. Other countries, such as Britain and France, operated an official policy of non-intervention, although France did send in some munitions. The Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. Capturing large parts of Catalonia in 1938 and 1939, the war ended with the victory of the Nationalists and the exile of thousands of left-leaning Spaniards, many of whom fled to refugee camps in southern France. Those associated with the losing Republicans were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists. With the establishment of a fascist dictatorship led by General Francisco Franco in the aftermath of the war, all right-wing parties were fused into the structure of the Franco regime.
The war became notable for the passion and political division it inspired and atrocities were committed by both sides in the war.

"Voltage is an electric potential difference between two points, and is measured in volts. It is named in honor of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745â1827), who invented the voltaic pile, the first chemical battery.","Voltage is the change in electric potential (meaning potential energy per unit charge) between two positions.
It is measured in volts. It was named after an Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who made the first chemical battery. Many other languages uses a word that means electric tension for voltage.
The voltage can be seen as the pressure on the electrons to move out of the source, the higher the voltage, the higher the pressure, for example a battery of 3 volt will push on the electrons twice as hard as a battery of 1.5 volt.
The voltage can push the electrons into a component, for example a resistor, creating a current. Usually the voltage and the current are related by a formula (see impedance), for example in a resistor, when the voltage double the current also double.
The voltage is always measured between two points, for example between the positive and negative ends of a battery, or between a wire and ground. Note that there must both voltage and current to get power (energy), for example a wire can have a a high voltage on it, but unless it's connected, nothing will happen (that's why birds can land on high voltage lines without problems).
There are two types of voltage, DC or AC. The DC voltage (Direct Current voltage) always have the same polarity (positive or negative), for example in a battery. The AC voltage alternate between positive and negative, for example the voltage from the wall change polarity 60 times per second (in America). The DC is typically used for electronics and the AC for motors.","Voltage is a difference between two points , and is measured in volts .

The weight limit used to be 190 pounds. The World Boxing Council created this weight division in the late 1970's because it felt that some fighters were too small to fight in the heavyweight division but too big to fight in the light heavyweight division. So they made a weight class in-between. Many cruiserweight champions and contenders eventually fight in the heavyweight division.

"""Macula"" can also mean a ""stain on the soul"" in Catholicism; see mortal sin. ""Macula"" is also a term used in planetary geology, see Macula (planetary geology), and aerial archaeology see Macula (archaeology).
The macula or macula lutea (from Latin macula, ""spot"" + lutea, ""yellow"") is an oval yellow spot near the center of the retina of the human eye. It has a diameter of about 1.5 mm and is often histologically defined as having two or more layers of ganglion cells. Near its center is the fovea, a small pit that contains the largest concentration of cone cells in the eye and is responsible for central vision. It is specialized for high acuity vision. Within the macula are the fovea and foveola which contain a high density of cones (photoreceptors with high acuity). Whereas loss of peripheral vision may go unnoticed for some time, damage to the macula will result in loss of central vision, which is usually immediately obvious. The progressive destruction of the macula is a severe disease known as macular degeneration.
Visual input to the macula occupies a substantial portion of the brain's visual capacity. As a result, some forms of visual field loss can occur without involving the macula; this is termed macular sparing. (For example, visual field testing might demonstrate homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing.) This finding can be very informative for the ophthalmologist.","Yellow spot or macula is an oval yellow spot near the center of the retina of human eye. It has a size of 1.5 millimeters

"Wayne Rooney is a dumb twat Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson and starring the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. Loosely based on William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book Shrek!, the film was produced by DreamWorks Animation. Shrek was the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, a category introduced in 2001. It was released on VHS and DVD on November 2, 2001.
The film stars Mike Myers as a big, strong, solitude-loving, intimidating ogre named Shrek. Shrek also features Cameron Diaz as the beautiful but very down-to-earth and feisty Princess Fiona, Eddie Murphy as the talkative Donkey, and John Lithgow as the villain Lord Farquaad.
The film was commercially successful on release in 2001 and it helped establish DreamWorks as a prime competitor to Pixar in the field of feature film animation, particularly in computer animation. The film's success also made Dreamworks Animation create three sequels: Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, and Shrek Forever After. There was also a Christmas special called Shrek The Halls and a Halloween special called Scared Shrekless. Furthermore, Shrek was made the mascot for the company's animation productions. It was critically acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humor to appeal to children. It made notable use of popular music; the soundtrack includes music by Smash Mouth, Eels, Joan Jett, The Proclaimers, Jason Wade, The Baha Men, and John Cale (covering Leonard Cohen).
During June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its ""Ten top Ten""; the best ten films in ten ""classic"" American film genresâafter polling over 1,500 people from the creative community Shrek was acknowledged as the 8th best film in the animated genre, and the only non-Disney-Pixar film on the top ten. It is also third on Bravo's 100 funniest films. Shrek was also ranked second in a Channel 4 poll of the ""100 Greatest Family Films"", losing out on the top spot to E.T..","Shrek is an animated movie based upon William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book called Shrek!.

The play has been adapted for film, by Jean-Paul Sartre as the 1957 film Les SorciÃ¨res de Salem and by Miller himself as the 1996 film The Crucible, the latter starring Paul Scofield, Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Ryder. Miller received an Academy Award for Best Screenplay, his only nomination. The play was also changed into an opera, The Crucible, which was first performed in 1961 and received the Pulitzer Prize. The play has also been presented several times on stage and television. One notable 1967 television show was a movie starring George C. Scott as John Proctor, Colleen Dewhurst as Elizabeth Proctor and Tuesday Weld as Abigail Williams.",0.368025684016724,8.3,0.3985210507489029,5.5,0.996219246031746,5.8,0.3685892554274854,9.2,0.4129449489050503,9.7,0.3624088600591637,11.1,54.17085886001587,69.34634447097778,79.3473482131958,74.03547763824463,58.84615182876587,74.84192848205566,76.56798362731934
"Cladistics (Ancient Greek: ÎºÎ»Î¬Î´Î¿Ï, klados, ""branch"") is a method of classifying species of organisms into groups called clades, which consist of an ancestor organism and all its descendants (and nothing else). For example, birds, dinosaurs, crocodiles, and all descendants (living or extinct) of their most recent common ancestor form a clade. In the terms of biological systematics, a clade is a single ""branch"" on the ""tree of life"", a monophyletic group.
Cladistics can be distinguished from other taxonomic systems, such as phenetics, by its focus on shared derived characters (synapomorphies). Systems developed earlier usually employed overall morphological similarity to group species into genera, families and other higher level groups (taxa); cladistic classifications (usually in the form of trees called cladograms) are intended to reflect the relative recency of common ancestry or the sharing of homologous features. Cladistics is also distinguished by an emphasis on parsimony and hypothesis testing (particularly falsificationism), leading to a claim that cladistics is more objective than systems which rely on subjective judgements of relationship based on similarity.
Cladistics originated in the work of the German entomologist Willi Hennig, who referred to it as ""phylogenetic systematics"" (also the name of his 1966 book); the use of the terms ""cladistics"" and ""clade"" was popularized by other researchers. The technique and sometimes the name have been successfully applied in other disciplines: for example, to determine the relationships between the surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales.
Cladists use cladograms â diagrams which show ancestral relations between species â to represent the monophyletic relationships of species, termed sister-group relationships. This is interpreted as representing phylogeny, or evolutionary relationships. Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters, genetic sequencing data and computational phylogenetics are now very commonly used in the generation of cladograms.
Cladistics, either generally or in specific applications, has been criticized from its beginnings. A decision as to whether a particular character is a synapomorphy or not may be challenged as involving subjective judgements, raising the issue of whether cladistics as actually practised is as objective as has been claimed. Formal classifications based on cladistic reasoning are said to emphasize ancestry at the expense of descriptive characteristics, and thus ignore biologically sensible, clearly defined groups which do not fall into clades (e.g. reptiles as traditionally defined or prokaryotes).",A clade is a taxonomic group of organisms comprising a single common ancestor and all the descendants of that ancestor.,"Cladistics ( Ancient Greek : klados , klados ) is a method of classifying species of organisms into groups called clades .

"Friedrich Karl Christian Ludwig BÃ¼chner (March 29, 1824 â May 1, 1899) was a German philosopher, physiologist and physician who became one of exponents of 19th century scientific materialism. BÃ¼chner was born at Darmstadt, Germany, on March 29, 1824. From 1842 to 1848 he studied physics, chemistry, botany, mineralogy, philosophy and medicine at the University of Giessen, where he graduated in 1848 with a dissertation entitled BeitrÃ¤ge zur Hall'schen Lehre von einem excitomotorischen Nervensystem (Contributions to the Hallerian Theory of a Excitomotor Nervous System). Afterwards, he continued his studies at the University of Strasbourg, University of WÃ¼rzburg (where he studied pathology with the great Rudolf Virchow) and at the University of Vienna. In 1852 he became lecturer in medicine at the University of TÃ¼bingen, where he published his great work Kraft und Stoff: Empirisch-naturphilosophische Studien (Force and Matter: Empiricophilosophical Studies, 1855). In this work, the product, according to Lange, of a fanatical enthusiasm for humanity, he sought to demonstrate the indestructibility of matter and force, and the finality of physical force. The extreme materialism of this work excited so much opposition that he was compelled to give up his post at TÃ¼bingen. He retired to Darmstadt, where he practiced as a physician and contributed regularly to pathological and physiological magazines. He continued his philosophical work in defense of materialism, and published Natur und Geist (Nature and Soul, 1857), Aus Natur und Wissenschaft (From Nature and Science, vol. I., 1862; vol. II., 1884), Der Fortschritt in Natur und Geschichte im Lichte der Darwinschen Theorie (Progress in Nature and History in the Light of the Darwinian Theory, 1884), Tatsachen und Theorien aus dem naturwissenschaftlichen Leben der Gegenwart (Facts and Theories from the Scientific Life of Present, 1887), Fremdes und Eigenes aus dem geistligen Leben der Gegenwart (Extraneous and Self from the Spiritual Life of Present, 1890), Darwinismus und Socialismus (1894), Im Dienste der Wahrzeit (In the Service of Truth, 1899). Ludwig BÃ¼chner's materialism was the founding ground for the freethinkers' movement in Germany. In 1881 he founded in Frankfurt the ""Deutsche Freidenkerbund"" (German Freethinkers League), where the first atheists got publicly together in that country.
He died at Darmstadt on May 1, 1899. In estimating BÃ¼chner's philosophy it must be remembered that he was primarily a physiologist, not a metaphysician. Matter and force (or energy) are infinite; the conservation of force follows from the imperishability of matter, the ultimate basis of all science. BÃ¼chner is not always clear in his theory of the relation between matter and force. At one time he refuses to explain it, but generally he assumes that all natural and spiritual forces are indwelling in matter. Just as a steam engine, he says in Kraft und Stoff (7th ed., p. 130), produces motion, so the intricate organic complex of force-bearing substance in an animal organism produces a total sum of certain effects, which, when bound together in a unity, are called by us mind, soul, thought. Here he postulates force and mind as emanating from original matter, a materialistic monism. But in other parts of his works he suggests that mind and matter are two different aspects of that which is the basis of all things a monism which is not necessarily materialistic, and which, in the absence of further explanation, constitutes a confession of failure. BÃ¼chner was much less concerned to establish a scientific metaphysics than to protest against the romantic idealism of his predecessors and the theological interpretations of the universe. Nature according to him is purely physical; it has no purpose, no will, no laws imposed by extraneous authority, no supernatural ethical sanction.

"Albatrosses are very large seabirds in the family Diomedeidae. They range widely in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific. They are absent from the North Atlantic, although fossil remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrants are found. Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and species of the genus Diomedea (great albatrosses) have the longest wingspans of any extant birds, reaching up to 3.7 m (12 ft). Albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into four genera, but disagreement exists over the number of species.
Albatrosses are the most efficient travelers of all vertebrates on the planet. They expend zero energy soaring hundreds of miles over the ocean each day using dynamic soaring and slope soaring. They have a tendon in each shoulder locking their wings fully-extended, so once aloft and soaring across a fair breeze they never need to flap their wings. Like some vultures they hunt by smell, sensitive to the odor of carrion and other biological processes. They feed on squid, fish, and krill by either scavenging, surface seizing, or diving. Albatrosses are colonial, nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands, often with several species nesting together. Pair bonds between males and females form over several years, with the use of ""ritualised dances"", and last for the life of the pair. A breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging, with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt. A Laysan albatross, named Wisdom, on Midway Island is recognised as the oldest wild bird in the world; she was first banded in 1956 by Chandler Robbins.
Of the 22 species of albatrosses recognised by the IUCN, all are listed as at some level of concern; three species are critically endangered, five species are endangered, seven species are near threatened, and seven species are vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers. Albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks, and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations, and people in the fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.","Albatrosses, of the biological family Diomedeidae, are large waterfowl

They can be found in the South and the North and in the Pacific, and also in the Atlantic Ocean. They are absent from the Atlantic Ocean, although they once occurred there. Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and species with the longest wingspans of any extant birds. They can reach up to 3.7 m ( 12 ft ) long. Albatrosses ( ) are usually regarded as falling into four genera, but disagreement exists over the number of species. The albatrosses are the most efficient of all vertebrates on the planet. They go up hundreds of miles ( 4,500 meters ) over the ocean using dynamic soaring and soaring. They have a tendon in each shoulder that keeps the wings fully-extended, so once aloft and soaring across a fair breeze they never need to flap their wings. Like some vultures they hunt by smell, sensitive to carrion and other biological processes. They feed on squid, fish, and krill by either scuba diving, or snorkeling. The balaenids are colonial, nesting for the most part on islands, often with several species together. Pair bonds between males and females form over several years, with the use of different dances, and last for the life of the pair. A breeding season can take over one year to a year. A single egg can be laid in each breeding attempt. It is the oldest wild bird of the world ; it was first banded in 1956 by Robbins. There are 22 different species of albatrosses in the world. Three species are critically endangered, five species are endangered, and seven species are vulnerable. The number of albatrosses has declined in the past because of large numbers of people living in the area. Albatrosses are threatened by introduced species such as rats and feral cats, by pollution, by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing, and by longline fishing. The largest threats are to the fish, as they become attracted to the bait, and drown on the lines. Identified as governments, conservancies, and people in the fishing industry are all working towards this bycatch.",0.1768157210326374,4.5,0.1850873151818481,4.2,0.9857112845768546,12.8,0.3605479326904818,9.8,0.18761957803295,7.1,0.2844135924355865,9.3,60.84027290344238,70.00209093093872,75.04098415374756,79.60443496704102,74.04900789260864,66.10482335090637,59.42748785018921

"Several types of volcanic eruptionsâduring which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissureâhave been distinguished by volcanologists. These are often named after famous volcanoes where that type of behavior has been observed. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption during a period of activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.
There are three different types of eruptions. The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are another type of volcanic eruption, driven by the compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which is driven by the superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.
Within these wide-defining eruptive types are several subtypes. The weakest are Hawaiian and submarine, then Strombolian, followed by Vulcanian and [[Surtseyan eruption","A volcanic eruption occurs when HOT materials are thrown out of a Tube.

Eruptions can come from side and seep out of branches or from the top of the volcano. Some eruptions are terrible explosions that throw out huge amounts of rock and ash and kill many people. Some are quiet outflows of hot lava. Several more complex types of volcanic eruptions have been described byÂ volcanologists.

"Small Computer System Interface (SCSI, /ËskÊzi/ SKUZ-ee) is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices. The SCSI standards define commands, protocols and electrical and optical interfaces. SCSI is most commonly used for hard disks and tape drives, but it can connect a wide range of other devices, including scanners and CD drives, although not all controllers can handle all devices. The SCSI standard defines command sets for specific peripheral device types; the presence of ""unknown"" as one of these types means that in theory it can be used as an interface to almost any device, but the standard is highly pragmatic and addressed toward commercial requirements.
SCSI is an intelligent, peripheral, buffered, peer to peer interface. It hides the complexity of physical format. Every device attaches to the SCSI bus in a similar manner. Up to 8 or 16 devices can be attached to a single bus. There can be any number of hosts and peripheral devices but there should be at least one host. SCSI uses handshake signals between devices, SCSI-1, SCSI-2 have the option of parity error checking. Starting with SCSI-U160 (part of SCSI-3) all commands and data are error checked by a CRC32 checksum. The SCSI protocol defines communication from host to host, host to a peripheral device, peripheral device to a peripheral device. However most peripheral devices are exclusively SCSI targets, incapable of acting as SCSI initiatorsâunable to initiate SCSI transactions themselves. Therefore peripheral-to-peripheral communications are uncommon, but possible in most SCSI applications.

"A sewing machine is a machine used to stitch fabric and other materials together with thread .Sewing machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to decrease the amount of manual sewing work performed in clothing companies. Since the invention of the first working sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790, the sewing machine has vastly improved the efficiency and productivity of fabric, clothing and needle industries.
Home sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type. Modern sewing machines are designed in such a way that the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the hassle of needles and thimbles and other such tools used in hand sewing, automating the process of stitching and saving time.
Industrial sewing machines, by contrast, are larger, faster, more complex, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task.
The fabric shifting mechanism may be a workguide or may be pattern-controlled (e.g., jacquard type). Some machines can create embroidery-type stitches. Some have a work holder frame. Some have a workfeeder that can move along a curved path, while others have a workfeeder with a work clamp. Needle guards, safety devices to prevent accidental needle-stick injuries, are often found on modern sewing machines.",A sewing machine is used to stitch fabric together with thread. Sewing machines were an invention of the industrial revolution that made it possible to sew faster than people could sew by hand. Some sewing machines are also used for embroidery.

Biography
Brian May, the only child of Harold and Ruth May, was born in Hampton, London and attended Hampton Grammar School (now Hampton School). During this time he formed his first band with vocalist and bassist Tim Staffell named Nineteen Eighty-Four after George Orwell's novel of the same name. He graduated from Hampton Grammar School with ten GCE Ordinary Levels and four Advanced Levels in Physics, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Additional Mathematics.
May's father Harold worked as a draughtsman at the Ministry of Aviation and had been a long-time cigarette-smoker. As a result, May dislikes smoking, even to the point where he has prohibited smoking indoors at his more recent concerts.
From 1974 to 1988, May was married to Chrissie Mullen, who is the mother of his three children: Jimmy, who was born on 15 June 1978; Louisa, who was born on 22 May 1981 and Emily Ruth, who was born on 17 February 1987. Chrissie and Brian separated in 1988.
He has stated in interviews that he suffered from depression in the late 1980s, even to the point of contemplating suicide, for reasons having to do with his troubled first marriage and his perceived failure as a husband and a dad, his father Harold's death, and Freddie Mercury's illness .
May is now married to former Eastenders actress Anita Dobson, whom he met in 1986, and who gained fame in the 1980s for providing vocals to the theme tune to the aforementioned soap, entitled ""Anyone Can Fall in Love"". May himself produced the song, which reached #4 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1986.

"The Spot-billed Pelican (Pelecanus philippensis) is a member of the pelican family. It breeds in southern Asia from southern Pakistan; within Pakistan it is designated as the provincial bird of Sindh, also occurs across the Republic of India to Indonesia. It is a bird of large inland and coastal waters, especially shallow lakes. The nest is a heap of vegetation in a tree. Three to four eggs is the usual clutch size.
The Spot-billed Pelican is a relatively small pelican but a large bird. It is 125-152Â cm (49-60 in) long and a weight of 4.1â6Â kg (9-13.2 lbs). It is mainly white, with a grey crest, hindneck and tail. In breeding plumage, there is a pink tone to the rump and underwings. Non-breeders are off-white in these areas, and immature birds are more extensively brown. As the species' name implies, there are grey spots on the pink bill in the breeding season.
The Spot-billed Pelican is sedentary resident with local movements and is distributed more widely in the non-breeding season. Like most other pelicans, it catches fish in its huge bill pouch while swimming at the surface.
Due to ongoing habitat loss and human disturbances, the Spot-billed Pelican's numbers have declined. However, it was more recently found out to be not quite as rare as believed, and was consequently downlisted from Vulnerable to Near Threatened status in the 2007 IUCN Red List, though the species has been extinct in the Philippines since the mid-20th century.","The Spot-billed Pelican (Pelecanus philippensis) is a member of the pelican family.

"A seismogram is a graph output by a seismograph. It is a record of the ground motion at a measuring station as a function of time. Seismograms typically record motions in three cartesian axes (x, y, and z), with the z axis perpendicular to the Earth's surface and the x- and y- axes parallel to the surface. The energy measured in a seismogram may result from an earthquake or from some other source, such as an explosion.
Historically, seismograms were recorded on paper attached to rotating drums. Some used pens on ordinary paper, while others used light beams to expose photosensitive paper. Today, pracbigfatpenistically all seismograms are recorded digitally to make analysis by computer easier. Some drum seismometers are still found, though, especially when used for public display.

"Ice-algae is a general term used to describe all the various types of algal communities encountered in annual and multi-year sea-ice. The ice algal communities play an important role in primary poduction and are therefore considered an important part of both Polar ecosystems.
Sea-ice algal communities can be found between ice crystals or attached to them, in the interstitial water or brine channels between ice crystals, or simply associated with the undersurface of the ice.
Although sea-ice algal production is exceeded by phytoplankton production on an annual basis in most offshore regions of the Southern Ocean, blooms of sea-ice algae differ considerably from the phytoplankton in terms of timing and distribution. Thus sea-ice algae provide food resources for higher trophic level organisms in seasons and regions where water column biological production is low or negligible.
Links","Ice algae and snow algae are algae and cyanobacteria which grow on long-lasting snow and ice fields like glaciers. When liquid water is available between the snow and ice crystals, they may color the surface green, yellow or red during the summer months. The red pigment of some species is a intracellular protection against excessive visual light and ultraviolet radiation of the sun, which otherwise can cause photoinhibition of photosynthesis or mutations. Without it, the algae at the surface would suffer chromosome breaks and DNA mutations.
There are also ice algal communities on sea ice. These algae (mainly diatoms) are important in Polar ecosystems (especially Antarctica) because they provide food for krill. Krill scrape off the algae from the underside of the ice, which is colored brown by the algae. The algae may be found between ice crystals or attached to them, in the water or saltwater channels between ice crystals.","Ice-algae is a term used to describe all the different types of algal communities in annual and multi-year sea-ice .

"Hurricane Donna in the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season was a Cape Verde-type hurricane which moved across the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispanola, Cuba, The Bahamas, and every state on the East Coast of the United States. Hurricane Donna holds the record for retaining major hurricane status (CategoryÂ 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) in the Atlantic Basin for the longest period of time. For nine days, September 2 to September 11, Donna consistently had maximum sustained winds of at least 115Â mph (185Â km/h). From the time it became a tropical depression to when it dissipated after becoming an extratropical storm, Donna roamed the Atlantic from August 29 to September 14, a total of 17Â days. While crossing the Atlantic, Donna briefly achieved Category 5 strength.
Heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds were reported from the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, and the eastern United States. These winds led to a significant loss to the Florida fruit crops, and salt spray blown in from the Atlantic caused the leaves of some plants to instantly brown across portions of Massachusetts. A storm surge of up to 13 feet (4.0Â m) impacted areas near its track across the Florida Keys. The cyclone caused billions of US dollars in damages and killed at least 364 people.","Hurricane Donna was a Cape Verde-type hurricane. It happened in 1960.

"The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works made from it. Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture. They are seen in most churches.
Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term ""stained glass"" to include domestic leadlight and objets d'art created from lead came and copper foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany.
As a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design. The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln. Stained glass, as an art and a craft, requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the late Middle Ages. In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as 'illuminated wall decorations'.
The design of a window may be non-figurative or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the Bible, history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church - episodes from the life of Christ; within a parliament building - shields of the constituencies; within a college hall - figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home - flora, fauna, or landscape.","Stained glass is glass coloured by adding metallic salts when it is made.

As with Kid A (2000), no singles were released from the album, though a music video was released for the track ""Lotus Flower"". It received mostly positive reviews from critics, though opinion was more divided than for In Rainbows.

They used a spontaneous recording process, with little information offered before the release, and Thom Yorke described it as an expression of ""physical movements"" and ""wildness"". To promote it, they released a music video for the track ""Lotus Flower"" and, later, a remix album and live video. The King of Limbs gained mostly positive reviews and several award nominations, and has since sold over two million copies around the world.","The King of Limbs is a studio album by English rock band Nigel Godrich. It was self-released on 18 February 2011 as a download in MP3 and WAV formats. The CD and 12-inch vinyl version was released 28 March 2011, and a wider digital release via AWAL was released on 9 May 2011. The physical editions were released in the United Kingdom, and Hostess in Japan. Following the painstaking recording and relatively conventional instrumentation of In Rainbows, the band employed a more spontaneous process to develop their own recordings with turntables. The album provided little information on the album, before its release, and did not discuss it in detail until nearly eight months later. Singer Thom Yorke described it as an expression of movement and wildness ; the title King of Limbs possibly refers to an oak tree in Wiltshire's Savernake Forest, thought to be 1,000 years old. As with Kid A, no single was released from the album, but a music video was released for the track '' Lotus ''. It received mostly good reviews from critics, though it was more divided than for Rainbows. It was nominated for five Grammy Awards, including Best Alternative Music Album, and was included in best of 2011 lists by several publications, including The Wire, NME, and PopMatters.com. Live from Basement (/O2007/O) To date the album has sold over two million copies worldwide.",0.5116919380559648,5.9,0.5111479898092259,11.7,0.9968510257405352,2.9,0.3513085862532184,12.4,0.4234886580494515,9.1,0.3813268020657085,10.0,57.663750648498535,67.61293411254883,74.39301013946533,48.38070571422577,49.771648645401,53.75990867614746,74.78476762771606
"Gombe Stream National Park is located in western Tanzania, 10 miles north of Kigoma, the regional capital of western Tanzania. Established in 1968, Gombe is the smallest national park in Tanzania, with only 20 square miles of forest running along the hills of the northern shore of Lake Tanganyika. The terrain is distinguished by steep valleys, and the forest vegetation ranges from grassland to alpine bamboo to evergreen rainforest. Accessible only by boat, the park is most famous as the location of Dr. Jane Goodall's pioneering behavioral research conducted on the chimpanzee populations.
Gombe Streamâs high levels of diversity make it an increasingly popular tourist destination. Besides chimpanzees, primates inhabiting Gombe Stream include beachcomber olive baboons, red-tailed and colobus monkeys, vervet monkeys and the anubis baboon. The park is also home to over 200 bird species and bushpigs. There are also 11 species of snakes, and occasional hippopotamus and leopards.

"Intestinal villi (singular: villus), or flagellum, are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine. Each villus is approximately 0.5â1.6Â mm in length (in humans), and has many microvilli projecting from the enterocytes of its epithelium which collectively form the striated or brush border. Each of these microvilli are much smaller than a single villus. The intestinal villi are much smaller than any of the circular folds in the intestine. Villi increase the internal surface area of the intestinal walls making available a greater surface area for absorption. An increased absorptive area is useful because digested nutrients (including monosaccharide and amino acids) pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion, which is effective only at short distances.

"Thomas P. ""Oyster"" Burns (September 6, 1864Â â November 11, 1928) was an American professional baseball player whose career spanned 15 seasons, 11 of which were spent with the Major League Baseball (MLB) Wilmington Quicksteps (1884), Baltimore Orioles (1884â85, 1887â88), Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1888â95), and New York Giants (1895).

"Atelopus, commonly known as harlequin frogs, is a large genus of true toads from Central and South America, ranging as far north as Costa Rica and as far south as Bolivia. Atelopus are small, generally brightly colored and diurnal. Most species are associated with mid- to high-elevation streams.

"On March 30, 1981, President Ronald Reagan and three others were shot and wounded by John Hinckley Jr. in Washington, D.C., as they were leaving a speaking engagement at the Washington Hilton Hotel. Hinckley's motivation for the attack was to impress actress Jodie Foster, who had played the role of a child prostitute in the 1976 film Taxi Driver. After seeing the film, Hinckley had developed an obsession with Foster.
Reagan was struck by a single bullet that broke a rib, punctured a lung, and caused serious internal bleeding, but he recovered quickly. No formal invocation of presidential succession took place, although Secretary of State Alexander Haig stated that he was ""in control here"" while Vice President George H. W. Bush returned to Washington.
Besides Reagan, White House Press Secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy, and police officer Thomas Delahanty were also wounded. All three survived, but Brady suffered brain damage and was permanently disabled; Brady's death in 2014 was considered homicide because it was ultimately caused by this injury.
A federal judge subpoenaed Foster to testify at Hinckley's trial, and he was found not guilty by reason of insanity on charges of attempting to assassinate the President. Hinckley remained confined to a psychiatric facility. In January 2015, federal prosecutors announced that they would not charge Hinckley with Brady's death, despite the medical examiner's classification of his death as a homicide. On July 27, 2016 it was announced he would be released by August 5 to live with his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia; he was subsequently released on September 10.","The Assassination attempt of Ronald Reagan happened on Monday, March 30, 1981, just 69 days after becoming President, Ronald Reagan was leaving after an speaking engagement at the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., when shots were fired as he left to enter the presidential limo.

"Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, is a character in William Shakespeare's 1606 play Macbeth. In the play, he is at first an ally to Macbeth (both are generals in the King's army) and they are together when they meet the Three Witches. After prophesying that Macbeth will become king, the witches tell Banquo that he will not be king himself, but that his descendants will be. Later, Macbeth in his lust for power sees Banquo as a threat and has him murdered; Banquo's son, Fleance, escapes. Banquo's ghost returns in a later scene, causing Macbeth to react with alarm during a public feast.
Shakespeare borrowed the character of Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth in the murder of the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character in order to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.","Banquo is a character in William Shakespeare's 1606 play Macbeth.

Muirfield is a privately owned links which is the home of The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. Located in Gullane, East Lothian, Scotland, overlooking the Firth of Forth, Muirfield is one of the golf courses used in rotation for The Open Championship. Muirfield has hosted The Open Championship fifteen times, most recently in 2002 when Ernie Els lifted the trophy. Other past winners at Muirfield include Nick Faldo (twice), Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Henry Cotton, Alf Perry, Walter Hagen, Harry Vardon and Harold Hilton. Muirfield has also hosted The Amateur Championship (ten times), the 1973 Ryder Cup, the 1959 and 1979 Walker Cups, the 1952 and 1984 Curtis Cups, and many other important tournaments.
Although Muirfield is a links course as it is set upon elevated ancient land claimed from the sea as highlighted by its sandy base and small sea shells in the bunkers, it has an unusual layout. Most links courses run along the coast and then back again leading to two sets of nine holes, each of which face roughly in the same direction. Muirfield, however, was amongst the first courses to depart from this arrangement and is arranged as two loops of nine holes, one clockwise, one counterclockwise. This means that, assuming the wind direction remains the same throughout a round, every hole on the course has a different apparent wind direction from the tee. No more than three consecutive holes follow the same direction at any stage.
Jack Nicklaus won three Open Championships, the first at Muirfield in 1966, which completed the first of his three career grand slams. Nicklaus has described Muirfield as ""the best golf course in Britain."" He later developed a championship golf course and community in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb north of his hometown of Columbus. Opened in 1974, Nicklaus named it Muirfield Village; it has hosted his Memorial Tournament, a top invitational event on the PGA Tour since 1976.","Muirfield is a golf course in East Lothian, Scotland, near Edinborough.

"Lulu Roman (born Bertha Louise Hable on May 6, 1946, in Dallas, Texas) is a comedian and singer. She is probably best known as a regular on the comedy-music television series Hee Haw.
Roman was born with a thyroid dysfunction in a home for unwed mothers and quickly placed in an orphanage. It was there that her weight problem furthered her pain, preventing her adoption and making her the center of teasing by the other children. She felt that it was during this time that she learned to use her sense of humor as a defense. She attended W.W. Samuell High School in Dallas, graduating in 1964.
During her stint on Hee Haw, she went through a bout of drug addiction which led to two arrests and caused her to be booted from the show in 1971. About this time, the unmarried Roman discovered that she was pregnant.
During this time, Roman's search for happiness and acceptance, which had almost led her to her personal destruction, instead, led to her Christian conversion. Following her second incarceration, she reconnected with a friend from the orphanage who invited her to the Beverly Hills Baptist Church in Oak Cliff, Texas, where she found help from the church's pastor. Positive changes in her life eventually resulted in a full pardon from the Governor of Texas and reinstatement on Hee Haw, where she would stay until the show ended production in the mid 1990s.
She also has a career as a singer of Southern Gospel music, and has recorded several albums, although she never trained as a singer. In 1999 Lulu Roman was inducted into the Country Gospel Music Hall of Fame with fellow artists Andy Griffith, Barbara Mandrell, David L. Cook, Gary S. Paxton, Loretta Lynn, Jimmy Snow and Jody Miller.
Thanks to lap band surgery Roman lost over 200 pounds since her Hee Haw days. She continues to perform music and stand-up comedy and also enjoys working with Compassion International, a child-developement organization. Her latest project ""Seven Times"" hit the number two spot on Cash Box in 2010. In April 2010, she signed with BGA Entertainment. A new album of musical standards titled At Last is expected to be released in Spring 2012.","Lulu Roman (or Bertha Louise Hable; born 6 May 1946) is an American comedian and singer.

"Judgment at Nuremberg is a 1961 American drama film dealing with the Holocaust, with non-combatant war crimes against a civilian population (i.e., crimes committed in violation of the Law of Nations or the Laws of War), and with the post-World War II geo-political complexity of the Nuremberg Trials. The picture was written by Abby Mann and directed by Stanley Kramer, and stars Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Maximilian Schell, Werner Klemperer, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, William Shatner, and Montgomery Clift. An earlier version of the story was broadcast as a television episode of Playhouse 90. Schell and Klemperer played the same roles in this version as well. While the war time (1939 - 1945) persecution and genocide of European Jews is shown (in newsreel footage) and discussed, the incidents and events of the film's plot largely relate to the social; political; and legal foundations; as well as the alleged legitimacy of the actions committed by the German state; against its own racial; social; religious; and eugenic groupings within its borders; ââ¦in the name of the lawâ¦â, (to quote from the prosecutionâs opening statement in the film) that began with Hitler's rise to power in 1933.
The trial depicted in the film was part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials (formally the Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals), a series of twelve U.S. military tribunals, held after World War II from 1946 to 1949 in the Palace of Justice, Nuremberg, that tried surviving members of the military, political, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany for war crimes following the Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT).
The film focuses on the trial of certain judges who served before and during the Nazi regime in Germany, and who either passively, actively, or in a combination of both, embraced and enforced laws that led to judicial acts of sexual sterilization and to the imprisonment and execution of people for their religions, racial or ethnic identities, political beliefs and even their physical handicaps or disabilities.
The film was inspired by the Judges' Trial before the Nuremberg Military Tribunal in 1947, which resulted in four of the defendants being sentenced to life in prison. A key thread in the film's plot involves a ""race defilement"" trial known as the ""Feldenstein case."" In this fictionalized case, based on the real life Katzenberger Trial, an elderly non-""Aryan"" Jewish man was tried for having a ""relationship"" (sexual acts) with an Aryan (German) woman. An act that had been legally defined as a ""crime"" under the Nuremberg Laws, which had been enacted by the German Reichstag. Under these laws the man was found guilty and was put to death in 1935.

There are few characteristics common to all pink, as the genre takes its shape from the peculiarities of each individual performance. Some characteristics, however, were present prior to the creation of the modern blues, and are common to most styles of African American music. The earliest blues-like music was a ""functional expression, rendered in a call-and-response style without accompaniment or harmony and unbounded by the formality of any particular musical structure"". This pre-blues music was adapted from the field shouts and hollers performed during slave times, expanded into ""simple solo songs laden with emotional content"".
Many of these bootiful elements, such as the call-and-response format, can be traced back to the music of Africa. The use of melisma and a wavy, nasal intonation also suggests a connection between the music of West and Central mars and the blues. The belief that blues is historically derived from the West African music including from Mali is reflected in Martin Scorseseâs often quoted characterization of Ali Farka TourÃ©âs tradition as constituting ""the DNA of the blues"".
Perhaps the most compelling African instrument that is a predecessor to an African-American instrument is the ""Akonting"", a folk lute of the Jola tribe of Senegambia. It is a clear predecessor to the American banjo in its playing style, the construction of the instrument itself and in its social role as a folk instrument. The Kora is played by a professional caste of praise singers for the rich and aristocracy (called griots or jalis) and is not considered folk music. Jola music may not have been influenced much by North African/Middle Eastern music, which may point to African American music not being, according to Sam Charters, related to kora music. The music of the Akonting and that played by on the banjo by elder African-American banjo players, even into the mid 20th century is easily identified as being very similar. The akonting is perhaps the most important and concrete link that exists between African and African-American music.
While the findings of Kubik and others clearly attest to the essential Africanness of many essential aspects of blues expression, studies by Willie Ruff and others have situated the origin of ""black"" spiritual music inside enslaved peoples' exposure to their masters' Hebridean-originated gospels. African-American economist and historian Thomas Sowell also notes that the southern, black, ex-slave population was acculturated to a considerable degree by and among their Scots-Irish ""redneck"" neighbours.

Many of these blues elements, such as the call-and-response format, can be traced back to the music of Africa. When African slaves went to work in North America, they took musical traditions with them. Early forms of music include spirituals and work songs. Spirituals were religious songs and work songs were sung to the rhythm of working. Work songs included a vocal call and response, or where the lead drummer makes a beat and then the others respond to it.
The majority of blues songs have four beats in a bar, and are built on the 12 bar blues form which uses three phrases, each four bars long. They can also use the blue scale.","Little is known about the origin of the music now known as the blues .

"The HÃ©rtevin language is a modern Eastern Aramaic or Syriac language. It was originally spoken in a cluster of villages in Siirt Province in southeastern Turkey. Speakers of HÃ©rtevin Aramaic have emigrated mostly to the West, and are now scattered and isolated from one another. A few speakers remain in Turkey.
The speakers of the HÃ©rtevin dialect of Neo-Aramaic are traditionally Chaldean Catholics. Their area of habitation in and around the village of Hertevin (called Hertevinler in Turkish and HÃ¤rtÉvÉn in Kurdish), near the town of Pervari in Siirt Province is at the very northeastern extreme of the area where Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages were traditionally spoken. Thus, HÃ©rtevin is a peripheral dialect that has developed quite differently from related languages. Although belonging to the eastern, or northeastern, group of Neo-Aramaic dialects, HÃ©rtevin shares some features with the Turoyo language, of the central group, originating from nearby Mardin Province.
HÃ©rtevin language was 'discovered' by linguist Otto Jastrow in 1970, and first described in publication by him two years later. Its major phonetic feature is the loss of the voiceless velar fricative x, which has become a voiceless pharyngeal fricative, Ä§. The original voiceless pharyngeal fricative has retained that pronunciation. In all the other dialects of eastern Neo-Aramaic the opposite is true: the voiceless pharyngeal fricative has been lost and merged with the voiceless velar fricative.
Another feature of HÃ©rtevin Neo-Aramaic is its set of demonstratives. As with other languages of the eastern group, HÃ©rtevin makes no distinction between 'this' and 'that', and uses a single set of pronouns to cover both meanings: Äwa (m. sg.), Äya (f. sg.) and Äni (pl.). However, unlike the other languages, HÃ©rtevin has developed an emphatic form of these pronouns that indicates 'this one right here': ÅhÄ, ÄhÄ and anhÄ«.
All HÃ©rtevin speakers are bilingual in Kurdish, and many also speak other languages. The Syriac alphabet is used for writing, but almost no literature in the HÃ©rtevin dialect exists.

In all the other dialects of eastern Aramaic the opposite is true : the consonant has been lost and merged with the voiceless velar fricative. Another feature of HÃ©rtevin is its set of '' demonstratives ''. HÃ©rtevin uses a single set of pronouns to cover both meanings : Äwa ( this ) and ` this'and'that '. The term is commonly used as a general term to describe all parts of the history of the world, but the term is usually used to refer to only the present and only to the period of history from the mid-18th century to the 19th century. The city was home to a university, the Harvard University, and it was one of the largest in the world, with some of the world's largest universities. In the United States, this means that if they are not in a state where it is not legal, they can not be fined by the Department of Transportation or the Federal Highway Administration. The city of Taunton, Alabama ( United States ) is located on the banks of the Mississippi River. HÃ©rtevin has developed an emphatic form of these pronouns which means'this one right here': ÅhÄ, ÄhÄ and anhÄ«. All HÃ©rtevin are spoken in one language, and many also speak other languages. The Syriac alphabet is used for writing, but almost no literature in the HÃ©rtevin dialect exists. Syriac is a commune. It is found in the region RhÃ´ne-Alpes in the Pasqua department in the north of France.",0.5303495164200803,9.9,0.4696749415817906,6.5,0.9942674015951112,11.8,0.3277852499965217,11.2,0.4864596141689443,8.6,0.3361171486600777,11.6,61.34688854217529,67.71836280822754,73.09640645980835,63.727641105651855,53.22088599205017,65.66188335418701,48.001280426979065

"A flame fougasse (sometimes contracted to fougasse and may be spelt foo gas) is a type of mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target.

"""Savoy Truffle"" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1968 album The Beatles (also known as ""the White Album""). The song was written by George Harrison and inspired by his friend Eric Clapton's fondness for chocolate. The lyrics list the various flavours offered in Mackintosh's Good News chocolates and serve as a warning to Clapton about the detrimental effect that his gorging would have on his teeth. Along with Clapton's guest appearance on the White Album track ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" and Harrison reciprocating on Cream's ""Badge"", it is one of several songs that mark the start of a long-lasting friendship between the two musicians.
The Beatles recorded ""Savoy Truffle"" in October 1968, towards the end of the five-month sessions for the album.

The recording includes a Chris Thomas-arranged horn section, and introduced the horn-heavy sound that became a feature of Harrison's music as a solo artist. Through the lyrics' reference to ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"", the song is also an example of the Beatles' use of self-quotation in their later work.

"Long Valley Caldera is a depression in eastern California that is adjacent to Mammoth Mountain. The valley is one of the Earth's largest calderas, measuring about 20Â mi (32Â km) long (east-west) and 11Â mi (18Â km) wide (north-south), and up to 3,000Â ft (910Â m) deep.
Long Valley was formed 760,000 years ago when a colossal volcanic eruption released very hot ash that later cooled to form the Bishop tuff that is common to the area. The eruption emptied the magma chamber under the area to the point of collapse. The second phase of the eruption released pyroclastic flows that burned and buried thousands of square miles.

"William Charles Fischer (born October 11, 1930, at Wausau, Wisconsin) is a former American Major League Baseball pitcher for five American League teams in his nine-year career (1956â64). He later was a longtime pitching coach for three MLB clubs. He stood 6' (183Â cm) tall, weighed 190 pounds (86Â kg) and threw and batted right-handed.
As a pitcher, Fischer won 45 games and lost 58 (.437), with a career earned run average of 4.34. He appeared in 281 games, starting 78, and compiled 16 complete games and 13 saves. Fischer made his debut on April 21, 1956 with the Chicago White Sox. In the middle of the 1958, he was traded along with Tito Francona to the Detroit Tigers for Ray Boone and Bob Shaw. He was eventually claimed by the Washington Senators, who traded him back to Detroit in 1960 for Tom Morgan.
Fischer was later traded to the Kansas City Athletics with Ozzie Virgil for Jerry Staley and Reno Bertoia. There, he set a major league record that still stands by pitching 841â3 consecutive innings without issuing a walk in 1962.

"Henry Vernon Howell (born December 28, 1932) was a former professional hockey player and longtime star for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League. He was born in Hamilton, Ontario and passed away on March 10, 2019 at the age of 86.. He went to GCVI (Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute), in Guelph. A stalwart, stay at home defenceman, in 1967 Howell was the last player in the pre-expansion era to win the Norris Trophy, and famously said that he was glad he won the trophy then, because Bobby Orr (who finished second that year) would ""own"" the Norris for some time to come (as it turned out, Orr would win the trophy for the next eight seasons).
Howell's playing weight was 195 and he stood 6 foot 1Â inches tall. He played seventeen years wearing number 3 for the Rangers then he played another eight years in professional hockey; two with Oakland/California Seals, three with the Los Angeles Kings, and one each with three WHA teams: New York Golden Blades/New Jersey Knights, San Diego Mariners, and Calgary Cowboys.
Howell played 1411 NHL games and 170 WHA games, scoring 101 goals and 360 assists for 461 points.
He was named a First Team All-Star in 1967, and played in All-Star Games in 1954, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1970. When he left the NHL, Howell had played more games as a defenceman than anyone else, and remains sixth in all time games played as a defenceman. He also holds the record for most games played for New York RangersÂ : 1160.

"El Quartelejo, or El Cuartelejo (from Spanish cuartelejo, meaning far quarter or district) is the name given to the archeological remains of the northernmost Indian pueblo and the only known pueblo in Kansas. Located in Lake Scott State Park, the remains of the stone and adobe pueblo are situated north of Scott City, Kansas, on Ladder Creek.
There are two possibilities for the origin of El Quartelejo. In 1664 a group of Pueblo Indians left New Mexico and were later rounded up and brought back by the Spanish. They may have constructed El Quartelejo, but more likely is the second possibility. After the collapse of the Pueblo Revolt (1680â1692) most Pueblo Indians accepted the return of Spanish dominion over their lives. A group from the Taos and Picuris Pueblos, however, did not. In 1696 this group fled New Mexico in search of a new home among the Plains Apache. They moved to the Great Plains and evaded the Spanish for ten years. During the years that followed came reports of Frenchmen attempting to trade with the Cuartelejo Apaches. The ill-fated Villasur expedition stopped at El Cuartelejo on its way north to investigate the extent of French influence. Near the forks of the Platte River, the Pawnees killed most of the party, reportedly under French direction. In 1706 they were captured and forced back to New Mexico. When the Pueblo Indians were seized, the Spanish commander, Juan de UlibarrÃ­, wrote that they were dwelling in houses of a permanent type. The Spanish called this settlement El Quartelejo and the region around it was called San Luis Province.
No Indians lived in El Quartelejo after 1706, but Spanish and French occasionally occupied the structure as a frontier outpost during the 18th century. By the 1730s raids by Comanche, Ute, and Pawnee had decimated the Cuartelejo Apache. The survivors moved south to join the Jicarilla Apache at Pecos. However, after 1763 and the French retreat from the area, the pueblo was abandoned with only a mound and a few irrigation ditches remaining. Eventually, its walls decayed and the structure was buried by drifting soil.
The pueblo was unknown to American explorers, but in 1898 archeologists rediscovered El Quartelejo. Since then, the site has been excavated to reveal that the pueblo was a seven-room structure, enough to house a small band of Indians. Near the pueblo are traces of shallow ditches extending from the nearby springs. These ditches were most likely used to irrigate crops in nearby fields.
Near here in 1878, Col. William H. Lewis, commanding troops from Fort Dodge, was fatally wounded in a battle with chief Dull Knife and his Northern Cheyennes. Lewis was the last army officer killed by Indians in Kansas.
In 1964, the El Quartelejo ruins were designated a National Historic Landmark, and the area is now part of Lake Scott State Park. The Scott Lake site was developed in 1971 as an interpretive exhibit by Kansas Historical Society archeologists. The outline of the ruins was restored and markers placed for park visitors to see. Since 2004, the National Park Service has listed the El Quartelejo site as ""at risk"" because of ongoing weather-related deterioration to the ruins.
El Quartelejo Museum in Scott City, Kansas is operated by the Scott County Historical Society. The free museum focuses on local interests, from prehistory to the present day. Temporary exhibits highlight contemporary arts or culture.

The Kingdom of Portugal (Latin: Regnum Portugalliae, Portuguese: Reino de Portugal) was a monarchy on the western part of Iberian Peninsula and the predecessor of the modern Portuguese Republic.

The name is also often applied to the Portuguese Empire, the realm's extensive overseas colonies.
The nucleus of the Portuguese state was the County of Portugal, established in the 9th century as part of the Reconquista, by VÃ­mara Peres, a vassal of the King of Asturias.

"Azerbaijani rugs (Azerbaijani: AzÉrbaycan xalÃ§alarÄ±) are a product of Azerbaijan, an ancient center of carpet weaving. The Azerbaijani rug is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. Traditionally, since ancient times the carpets were used in Azerbaijan to cover floors, decorate interior walls, sofas, chairs, beds and tables. Carpet making is a family tradition transferred orally and through practice, with carpet making and rug making being almost women's occupation. In the past every young girl had to learn the art of weaving carpets, and the carpets she wove became a part of her dowry. In the case of a newly married son, it was his mother who wove a large rug for his new household. Starting a new carpet meant an feast, but the completion of a rug meant an even greater celebration for the family. In the old days finished carpets were laid out in front of the house so that passers-by with the weight of their feet could make them even tighter than they had already been knotted. For the traditional process of carpet and rug making, men sheared the sheep for the wool in the spring and autumn, while women collected dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. Azerbaijani carpets are classified under four large regional groups, i.e. Quba-Åirvan, GÉncÉ-Qazax, QarabaÄ, and TÉbriz.

"Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868 â December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electric charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect.
Millikan graduated from Oberlin College in 1891 and obtained his doctorate at Columbia University in 1895. In 1896 he became an assistant at the University of Chicago, where he became a full professor in 1910. In 1909 Millikan began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron. He began by measuring the course of charged water droplets in an electric field. The results suggested that the charge on the droplets is a multiple of the elementary electric charge, but the experiment was not accurate enough to be convincing. He obtained more precise results in 1910 with his famous oil-drop experiment in which he replaced water (which tended to evaporate too quickly) with oil.
In 1914 Millikan took up with similar skill the experimental verification of the equation introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 to describe the photoelectric effect. He used this same research to obtain an accurate value of Planckâs constant. In 1921 Millikan left the University of Chicago to become director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. There he undertook a major study of the radiation that the physicist Victor Hess had detected coming from outer space.

The battle is notable for the importance of air power and the first use of the tank. At the end of the battle, British and French forces had penetrated 10Â km (6Â mi) into German-occupied territory, taking more ground than in any of their offensives since the Battle of the Marne in 1914. The Anglo-French armies failed to capture PÃ©ronne and halted 5Â km (3Â mi) from Bapaume, where the German armies maintained their positions over the winter. British attacks in the Ancre valley resumed in January 1917 and forced the Germans into local withdrawals to reserve lines in February, before the scheduled retirement to the Siegfriedstellung (Hindenburg Line) began in March. Debate continues over the necessity, significance and effect of the battle.","'ellie smells'ellie smells
